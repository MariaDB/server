Description: MySQL derived normalizer for Groonga
 Groonga is an open-source fulltext search engine and column store.
 It lets you write high-performance applications that requires fulltext
 search.
 .
 This package provides a normalizer which normalizes text as same as
 MySQL does.
 .
 Groonga has its own normalizers by default, but that behavior is a bit
 defferent from MySQL does, so as a result, it affects search results.
 These normalizers are useful if you regards it important for keeping
 normalizer compatibility with MySQL in Mroonga which uses Groonga as
 storage engine.
