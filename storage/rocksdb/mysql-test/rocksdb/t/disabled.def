##  Tests that are disabled in the upstream
##
cons_snapshot_serializable : Consistent read does not work on serializable
level_read_uncommitted : Not supported

##
##  Tests that require FB/MySQL specific features for which there are
##  no plans of ever porting them into MariaDB
##

##
##  Tests that do not fit MariaDB's test environment. Upstream seems to test
##  on boxes with much more RAM and CPU, some tests are more of a stress tests
##  than functional tests or bug testcases.
##
