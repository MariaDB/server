# There are two possible scenarios:
#  ha_rocksdb.{dll,so} is still loaded into mysqld's address space. Its
#  global variables are in the state that doesn't allow it to be
#  initialized back (this is what MDEV-15686 is about). This is handled 
#  by intentionally returning an error from rocksdb_init_func.
#
#  The second case is when ha_rocksdb.{ddl,so} has been fully unloaded 
#  and so it will be now loaded as if it happens for the first time.
