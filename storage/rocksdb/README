== Summary ==
This directory contains RocksDB-based Storage Engine (RDBSE) for MySQL = "MyRocks". 

== Resources ==
See https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6/wiki/Getting-Started-with-MyRocks
Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/mysqlonrocksdb/

== Coding Conventions ==
The baseline for MyRocks coding conventions is the MySQL set, available at
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/coding-guidelines.html.

Several refinements:
  0. There is an umbrella C++ namespace named "myrocks" for all MyRocks code.
  1. We introduced "RDB" as the super-short abbreviation for "RocksDB". We will
     use it as a name prefix, with different capitalization (see below), to ease
     up code navigation with ctags and grep.
     N.B. For ease of matching, we'll keep the variables and functions dealing
          with sysvars as close as possible to the outside visible names of
          sysvars, which start with "rocksdb_" prefix, the outward storage
          engine name.
  2. The names for classes, interfaces, and C++ structures (which act as
     classes), start with prefix "Rdb_".
     NB: For historical reasons, we'll keep the "ha_<storage_engine_name>" class
         name for ha_rocksdb class, which is an exception to the rule.
  3. The names for global objects and functions start with prefix "rdb_".
  4. The names for macros and constants start with prefix "RDB_".
  5. Regular class member names start with "m_".
  6. Static class member names start with "s_".
  7. Given the 80 character per line limit, we'll not always use full English
     words in names, when a well known or easily recognizable abbreviation
     exists (like "tx" for "transaction" or "param" for "parameter" etc).
  8. When needing to disambiguate, we use different suffixes for that, like
     "_arg" for a function argument/parameter, "_arr" for a C style array, and
     "_vect" for a std::vector etc.

== Running Tests ==
To run tests from rocksdb, rocksd_rpl or rocksdb_sys_vars packages, use the following parameters:
--mysqld=--default-storage-engine=rocksdb  --mysqld=--skip-innodb --mysqld=--default-tmp-storage-engine=MyISAM --mysqld=--rocksdb
