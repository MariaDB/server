// - initialize a lock request
// - start to try to acquire the lock
// - do something else
// - wait for the lock request to be resolved on a timed condition
// - destroy the lock request
// a lock request is resolved when its state is no longer pending, or
// when it becomes granted, or timedout, or deadlocked. when resolved, the
// state of the lock request is changed and any waiting threads are awakened.
