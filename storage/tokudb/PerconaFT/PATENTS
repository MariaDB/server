PATENT RIGHTS GRANT:
  "THIS IMPLEMENTATION" means the copyrightable works distributed by
  Percona as part of the Fractal Tree project.
  "PATENT CLAIMS" means the claims of patents that are owned or
  licensable by Percona, both currently or in the future; and that in

  patentability, enforceability and/or non-infringement of any of the

  the PATENT CLAIMS, a non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
  irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to

  licensee institute or order or agree to the institution of a PATENT
  CHALLENGE, then Percona may terminate any rights granted to you
  under this License.
