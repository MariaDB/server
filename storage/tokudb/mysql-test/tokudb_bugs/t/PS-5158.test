# Test for PS-5163 : [PS8QA] handle_fatal_signal (sig=11) in DsMrr_impl::dsmrr_init
# and PS-4828 : Inserting data into TokuDB database with name that contains non-alphanumerical characters can lead to the ZN9ha_tokudb16bulk_insert_pollEPvf assertion
#
# The cause is a buffer overrun in LOADER_CONTEXT where the char buffer used for
# maintaining the proc info string was too small and no validation or prevention
# was being done to ensure the string stayed within the limits of the buffer.
# Normally this would have been difficult to hit, but, now with the combination
# of tokudb_dir_per_db=ON and the expansion of the database name from latin1
# (or whatever) to the fscs encoding the space required for a max length
# db.table name could be quite larger than the buffer was originally sized.
