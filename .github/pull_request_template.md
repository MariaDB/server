## Release Notes
TODO: What should the release notes say about this change?
Include any changed system variables, status variables or behaviour. Optionally list any https://mariadb.com/kb/ pages that need changing.

## How can this PR be tested?

<!--
In many cases, this will be as simple as modifying one `.test` and one `.result` file in the `mysql-test/` subdirectory.
Without automated tests, future regressions in the expected behavior can't be automatically detected and verified.
-->

If the changes are not amenable to automated testing, please explain why not and carefully describe how to test manually.
