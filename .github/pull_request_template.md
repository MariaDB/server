An amazing description should answer some questions like:
1. What problem is the patch trying to solve?
2. If some output changed, what was it looking like before
   the change and how it's looking with this patch applied
3. Do you think this patch might introduce side-effects in
   other parts of the server?

## Description
TODO: fill description here

## How can this PR be tested?

TODO: modify the automated test suite to verify that the PR causes MariaDB to
behave as intended. Consult the documentation on
["Writing good test cases"](https://mariadb.org/get-involved/getting-started-for-developers/writing-good-test-cases-mariadb-server).
In many cases, this will be as simple as modifying one `.test` and one `.result`
file in the `mysql-test/` subdirectory. Without _automated_ tests, future regressions
in the expected behavior can't be automatically detected and verified.

If the changes are not amenable to automated testing, please explain why not and
carefully describe how to test manually.
