MariaDB: The innovative open source database

MariaDB is a community-developed, open source relational database management system (RDBMS) designed as a drop-in replacement for MySQL(R). It provides enhanced performance, improved scalability, additional storage engines, and new features while maintaining high compatibility with MySQL applications.

MariaDB is brought to you by the MariaDB Foundation and the MariaDB Corporation. Please read the CREDITS file for details about the MariaDB Foundation and the developers contributing to MariaDB.

MariaDB is developed by many of the original developers of MySQL who now work for the MariaDB Corporation, the MariaDB Foundation, and by numerous contributors from the global open source community.

MySQL, which serves as the original base of MariaDB, is a product and trademark of Oracle Corporation, Inc. For a list of developers and other contributors, see the Credits appendix. You can also run SHOW authors to get a list of active contributors.
