## MariaDB: drop-in replacement for MySQL

MariaDB is designed as a drop-in replacement of MySQL(R) with more
features, new storage engines, fewer bugs, and better performance.

MariaDB is brought to you by the MariaDB Foundation.
Please read the CREDITS file for details about the MariaDB Foundation,
and who is developing MariaDB.

MariaDB is developed by many of the original developers of MySQL who
now work for the MariaDB Foundation and the MariaDB Corporation, and by many people in
the community.

MySQL, which is the base of MariaDB, is a product and trademark of Oracle
Corporation, Inc. For a list of developers and other contributors,
see the Credits appendix.  You can also run 'SHOW authors' to get a
list of active contributors.

A description of the MariaDB project and a manual can be found at:

https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-versus-mysql-features/

https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-versus-mysql-compatibility/

As MariaDB is a full replacement of MySQL, the MySQL manual at
http://dev.mysql.com/doc is generally applicable.
