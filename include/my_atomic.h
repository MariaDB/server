/*
  This header defines five atomic operations:

  my_atomic_add#(&var, what)
  my_atomic_add#_explicit(&var, what, memory_order)
    'Fetch and Add'
    add 'what' to *var, and return the old value of *var
    All memory orders are valid.

  my_atomic_fas#(&var, what)
  my_atomic_fas#_explicit(&var, what, memory_order)
    'Fetch And Store'
    store 'what' in *var, and return the old value of *var
    All memory orders are valid.

  my_atomic_cas#(&var, &old, new)
  my_atomic_cas#_weak_explicit(&var, &old, new, succ, fail)
  my_atomic_cas#_strong_explicit(&var, &old, new, succ, fail)
    'Compare And Swap'
    if *var is equal to *old, then store 'new' in *var, and return TRUE
    otherwise store *var in *old, and return FALSE
    succ - the memory synchronization ordering for the read-modify-write
    operation if the comparison succeeds. All memory orders are valid.
    fail - the memory synchronization ordering for the load operation if the
    comparison fails. Cannot be MY_MEMORY_ORDER_RELEASE or
    MY_MEMORY_ORDER_ACQ_REL and cannot specify stronger ordering than succ.

    The weak form is allowed to fail spuriously, that is, act as if *var != *old
    even if they are equal. When a compare-and-exchange is in a loop, the weak
    version will yield better performance on some platforms. When a weak
    compare-and-exchange would require a loop and a strong one would not, the
    strong one is preferable.

  my_atomic_load#(&var)
  my_atomic_load#_explicit(&var, memory_order)
    return *var
    Order must be one of MY_MEMORY_ORDER_RELAXED, MY_MEMORY_ORDER_CONSUME,
    MY_MEMORY_ORDER_ACQUIRE, MY_MEMORY_ORDER_SEQ_CST.

  my_atomic_store#(&var, what)
  my_atomic_store#_explicit(&var, what, memory_order)
    store 'what' in *var
    Order must be one of MY_MEMORY_ORDER_RELAXED, MY_MEMORY_ORDER_RELEASE,
    MY_MEMORY_ORDER_SEQ_CST.

  '#' is substituted by a size suffix - 8, 16, 32, 64, or ptr
  (e.g. my_atomic_add8, my_atomic_fas32, my_atomic_casptr).

  The first version orders memory accesses according to MY_MEMORY_ORDER_SEQ_CST,
  the second version (with _explicit suffix) orders memory accesses according to
  given memory order.

  memory_order specifies how non-atomic memory accesses are to be ordered around
  an atomic operation:

  MY_MEMORY_ORDER_RELAXED - there are no constraints on reordering of memory
                            accesses around the atomic variable.
  MY_MEMORY_ORDER_CONSUME - no reads in the current thread dependent on the
                            value currently loaded can be reordered before this
                            load. This ensures that writes to dependent
                            variables in other threads that release the same
                            atomic variable are visible in the current thread.
                            On most platforms, this affects compiler
                            optimization only.
  MY_MEMORY_ORDER_ACQUIRE - no reads in the current thread can be reordered
                            before this load. This ensures that all writes in
                            other threads that release the same atomic variable
                            are visible in the current thread.
  MY_MEMORY_ORDER_RELEASE - no writes in the current thread can be reordered
                            after this store. This ensures that all writes in
                            the current thread are visible in other threads that
                            acquire the same atomic variable.
  MY_MEMORY_ORDER_ACQ_REL - no reads in the current thread can be reordered
                            before this load as well as no writes in the current
                            thread can be reordered after this store. The
                            operation is read-modify-write operation. It is
                            ensured that all writes in another threads that
                            release the same atomic variable are visible before
                            the modification and the modification is visible in
                            other threads that acquire the same atomic variable.
  MY_MEMORY_ORDER_SEQ_CST - The operation has the same semantics as
                            acquire-release operation, and additionally has
                            sequentially-consistent operation ordering.

  We choose implementation as follows: on Windows using Visual C++ the native
  implementation should be preferable. When using gcc we prefer the Solaris
  implementation before the gcc because of stability preference, we choose gcc
  builtins if available.
