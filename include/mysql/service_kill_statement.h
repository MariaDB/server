  This service provides functions that allow plugins to support
  the KILL statement.

  In MySQL support for the KILL statement is cooperative. The KILL
  statement only sets a "killed" flag. This function returns the value
  of that flag.  A thread should check it often, especially inside
  time-consuming loops, and gracefully abort the operation if it is
  non-zero.
