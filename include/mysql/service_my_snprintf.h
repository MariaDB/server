  my_snprintf service

  Portable and limited vsnprintf() implementation.

  This is a portable, limited vsnprintf() implementation, with some
  extra features. "Portable" means that it'll produce identical result
  on all platforms (for example, on Windows and Linux system printf %e
  formats the exponent differently, on different systems %p either
  prints leading 0x or not, %s may accept null pointer or crash on
  it). "Limited" means that it does not support all the C89 features.
  But it supports few extensions, not in any standard.

  my_vsnprintf(to, n, fmt, ap)

  @param[out] to     A buffer to store the result in
  @param[in]  n      Store up to n-1 characters, followed by an end 0
  @param[in]  fmt    printf-like format string
  @param[in]  ap     Arguments

  @return a number of bytes written to a buffer *excluding* terminating '\0'

  @note
  The syntax of a format string is generally the same:
  %[<flag>][<length>][.<precision>][<size modifier>]<format>[<format extension>]
  where everything but the <format> is optional.

  Two one-character <flags> are recognized:
    '0' has the standard zero-padding semantics;
    '-' is parsed, but silently ignored;

  Both <length> and <precision> are the same as in the standard.
  They can be specified as integers, or as '*' to consume an int argument.

  <size modifier> can be 'l', 'll', or 'z'.

  Supported <format>s are 's' (null pointer is accepted, printed as "(null)"),
  'c', 'd', 'i', 'u', 'x', 'X', 'o', 'p' (works as "0x%x"), 'f', and 'g'.

  The '$n' syntax for positional arguments is supported.

  Format extensions:

    Format 'sQ'
      quotes the string with '`' (backtick)s similar to "`%s`",
      but also "escapes" existing '`'s in the string to '``' as in SQL ''''.

    Format 'sB'
      treats the argument as a byte sequence. It reads and prints exactly
      <precision> bytes without terminating on any '\0's in the sequence.
      The default <precision> when it's unspecified is not defined.

    Format 'uE'
      treats the argument as an errno number. It prints this number, a space,
      then its corresponding error message in double quotes. In other words:
        printf("%uE", n) === printf("%d \"%sT\"", n, strerror(n))

    Format 'sT'
      replaces the end of the printed string with "..." if it was truncated.

    Format 'sS' and 'uU'
      are synonyms of 's' and 'u' respectively. They are escapes that avoid
      consuming the following plain char as one of the above extension suffixes.
      Example: "Data size: %uUEiB"

    Unrecognized and multiple suffixes are not parsed;
      for example, both "%sTQ" and "%uQ" will print a literal 'Q'.
