This directory contains a test suite for the MariaDB daemon. To run
the currently existing test cases, execute ./mysql-test-run in
this directory.

For use in distributions, you should run the script as user mysql.
This user may be created with nologin shell however, so the best bet is something like
       $ su -
       # cd /usr/share/mysql-test
       # su -s /bin/bash mysql -c "./mysql-test-run --skip-test-list=unstable-tests"

This will use the installed mysql executables, but will run a private copy
of the server process (using data files within /usr/share/mysql-test),
so you need not start the mysqld service beforehand.

The "--skip-test-list=unstable-tests" option excludes tests that are
known to fail.  You can omit it if you want to check whether such failures
occur for you.  Documentation about the reasons for omitting such tests can
be found in the file unstable-tests.

Distributions may include additional tests in an additional file like Red Hat's
rh-skipped-tests.list.

To clean up afterwards, remove the created "var" subdirectory, e.g.
  # su -s /bin/bash - mysql -c "rm -rf /usr/share/mysql-test/var"

If one or more tests fail on your system on reasons other than listed
in lists of unstable tests, please read the following manual section
for instructions on how to report the problem:

If you want to use an already running MySQL server for specific tests,
use the --extern option to mysql-test-run. Please note that in this mode,
you are expected to provide names of the tests to run.

For example, here is the command to run the "alias" and "analyze" tests
with an external server:

  # mysql-test-run --extern socket=/tmp/mysql.sock alias analyze

To match your setup, you might need to provide other relevant options.

With no test names on the command line, mysql-test-run will attempt
to execute the default set of tests, which will certainly fail, because
many tests cannot run with an external server (they need to control the
options with which the server is started, restart the server during
execution, etc.)

You can create your own test cases. To create a test case, create a new
file in the t subdirectory using a text editor. The file should have a .test
extension. For example:

  # xemacs t/test_case_name.test

In the file, put a set of SQL statements that create some tables,
load test data, and run some queries to manipulate it.

Your test should begin by dropping the tables you are going to create and
end by dropping them again.  This ensures that you can run the test over
and over again.

If you are using mysqltest commands in your test case, you should create
the result file as follows:

  # mysql-test-run --record test_case_name

  or

  # mysqltest --record < t/test_case_name.test

If you only have a simple test case consisting of SQL statements and
comments, you can create the result file in one of the following ways:

  # mysql-test-run --record test_case_name

  # mysql test < t/test_case_name.test > r/test_case_name.result

  # mysqltest --record --database test --result-file=r/test_case_name.result < t/test_case_name.test

When this is done, take a look at r/test_case_name.result .
If the result is incorrect, you have found a bug. In this case, you should
edit the test result to the correct results so that we can verify that
the bug is corrected in future releases.

If you want to submit your test case you can send it 
to maria-developers@lists.launchpad.net or attach it to a bug report on
http://mariadb.org/jira/.

If the test case is really big or if it contains 'not public' data,
then put your .test file and .result file(s) into a tar.gz archive,
add a README that explains the problem, ftp the archive to
ftp://ftp.askmonty.org/private and submit a report to
http://mariadb.org/jira about it.
