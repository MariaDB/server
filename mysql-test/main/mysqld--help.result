Windows bug: new line disappears when it is exactly at the right offset.
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults Don't read default options from any option file.
The following specify which files/extra groups are read (specified before remaining options):
--defaults-file=# Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=# Additionally read default groups with # appended as a suffix.

 --allow-suspicious-udfs 
 Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
 without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
 also means that one can load any function from any
 library, for example exit() from libc.so
 --alter-algorithm[=name] 
 Specify the alter table algorithm. One of: DEFAULT, COPY,
 INPLACE, NOCOPY, INSTANT
 --analyze-sample-percentage=# 
 Percentage of rows from the table ANALYZE TABLE will
 sample to collect table statistics. Set to 0 to let
 MariaDB decide what percentage of rows to sample.
 -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
 --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
 Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
 --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
 Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
 auto-increment-increment != 1
 --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
 --automatic-sp-privileges 
 Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
 --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MariaDB can
 have. This comes into play when the main MariaDB thread
 gets very many connection requests in a very short time
 (Automatically configured unless set explicitly)
 -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
 resolved relative to this
 --big-tables        Old variable, which if set to 1, allows large result sets
 by saving all temporary sets to disk, avoiding 'table
 full' errors. No longer needed, as the server now handles
 this automatically.
 --bind-address=name IP address to bind to.
 --binlog-alter-two-phase 
 When set, split ALTER at binary logging into 2
 statements: START ALTER and COMMIT/ROLLBACK ALTER
 --binlog-annotate-row-events 
 Tells the master to annotate RBR events with the
 statement that caused these events
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-annotate-row-events to disable.)
 --binlog-cache-size=# 
 The size of the transactional cache for updates to
 transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
 use transactions containing many statements, you can
 increase this to get more performance
 --binlog-checksum=name 
 Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
 events in the binary log. One of: NONE, CRC32
 --binlog-commit-wait-count=# 
 If non-zero, binlog write will wait at most
 binlog_commit_wait_usec microseconds for at least this
 many commits to queue up for group commit to the binlog.
 This can reduce I/O on the binlog and provide increased
 opportunity for parallel apply on the slave, but too high
 a value will decrease commit throughput.
 --binlog-commit-wait-usec=# 
 Maximum time, in microseconds, to wait for more commits
 to queue up for binlog group commit. Only takes effect if
 the value of binlog_commit_wait_count is non-zero.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log.
 Before using this option make sure that there are no
 dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
 tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
 SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
 from the master.
 --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
 database, and exclude all others not explicitly
 mentioned.
 --binlog-expire-logs-seconds=# 
 If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
 binlog_expire_logs_seconds seconds; It and
 expire_logs_days are linked, such that changes in one are
 converted into the other. Possible purges happen at
 startup and at binary log rotation.
 --binlog-file-cache-size=# 
 The size of file cache for the binary log
 --binlog-format=name 
 What form of binary logging the master will use: either
 ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
 statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
 statement-based binary logging except for those
 statements where only row-based is correct: those which
 involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
 function; for those, row-based binary logging is
 automatically used.
 --binlog-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the master that updates to the given database
 should not be logged to the binary log.
 --binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling 
 Run fast part of group commit in a single thread, to
 optimize kernel thread scheduling. On by default. Disable
 to run each transaction in group commit in its own
 thread, which can be slower at very high concurrency.
 This option is mostly for testing one algorithm versus
 the other, and it should not normally be necessary to
 change it.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling to disable.)
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
 The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
 --binlog-row-image=name 
 Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
 'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
 columns in the before and after image are logged.
 'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
 whenever possible (eg, blob column was not changed or is
 not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
 equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
 the table) is logged in the before image, and only
 changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
 FULL).
 --binlog-row-metadata=name 
 Controls whether metadata is logged using FULL , MINIMAL
 format and NO_LOG.FULL causes all metadata to be logged;
 MINIMAL means that only metadata actually required by
 slave is logged; NO_LOG NO metadata will be
 logged.Default: NO_LOG.
 --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
 The size of the statement cache for updates to
 non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
 often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
 can increase this to get more performance.
 --bootstrap         Used by mysql installation scripts.
 --bulk-insert-buffer-size=# 
 Size of tree cache used in bulk insert optimisation. Note
 that this is a limit per thread!
 --character-set-client-handshake 
 Don't ignore client side character set value sent during
 handshake.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-character-set-client-handshake to disable.)
 --character-set-filesystem=name 
 Set the filesystem character set.
 -C, --character-set-server=name 
 Set the default character set.
 --character-sets-dir=name 
 Directory where character sets are
 -r, --chroot=name   Chroot mysqld daemon during startup.

 Set the default collation.
 --column-compression-threshold=# 
 Minimum column data length eligible for compression
 --column-compression-zlib-level=# 
 zlib compression level (1 gives best speed, 9 gives best
 compression)
 --column-compression-zlib-strategy=name 
 The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression
 algorithm. Use the value DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal
 data, FILTERED for data produced by a filter (or
 predictor), HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only
 (no string match), or RLE to limit match distances to one
 (run-length encoding). Filtered data consists mostly of
 small values with a somewhat random distribution. In this
 case, the compression algorithm is tuned to compress them
 better. The effect of FILTERED is to force more Huffman
 coding and less string matching; it is somewhat
 intermediate between DEFAULT_STRATEGY and HUFFMAN_ONLY.
 RLE is designed to be almost as fast as HUFFMAN_ONLY, but
 give better compression for PNG image data. The strategy
 parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the
 correctness of the compressed output even if it is not
 set appropriately. FIXED prevents the use of dynamic
 Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler decoder for special
 applications.
 --column-compression-zlib-wrap 
 Generate zlib header and trailer and compute adler32
 check value. It can be used with storage engines that
 don't provide data integrity verification to detect data
 corruption.
 --completion-type=name 
 The transaction completion type. One of: NO_CHAIN, CHAIN,
 RELEASE
 --concurrent-insert[=name] 
 Use concurrent insert with MyISAM. One of: NEVER, AUTO, 
 ALWAYS

 window on windows.
 --core-file         Write core on errors.
 -h, --datadir=name  Path to the database root directory

 means automatic password expiration is disabled. If the
 value is a positive integer N, the passwords must be
 changed every N days. This behavior can be overridden
 using the password expiration options in ALTER USER.

 The default week format used by WEEK() functions
 --delay-key-write[=name] 
 Specifies how MyISAM tables handles CREATE TABLE
 DELAY_KEY_WRITE. If set to ON, the default, any DELAY KEY
 WRITEs are honored. The key buffer is then flushed only
 when the table closes, speeding up writes. MyISAM tables
 should be automatically checked upon startup in this
 case, and --external locking should not be used, as it
 can lead to index corruption. If set to OFF, DELAY KEY
 WRITEs are ignored, while if set to ALL, all new opened
 tables are treated as if created with DELAY KEY WRITEs
 enabled.
 --delayed-insert-limit=# 
 After inserting delayed_insert_limit rows, the INSERT
 DELAYED handler will check if there are any SELECT
 statements pending. If so, it allows these to execute
 before continuing.
 --delayed-insert-timeout=# 
 How long a INSERT DELAYED thread should wait for INSERT
 statements before terminating
 --delayed-queue-size=# 
 What size queue (in rows) should be allocated for
 handling INSERT DELAYED. If the queue becomes full, any
 client that does INSERT DELAYED will wait until there is
 room in the queue again
 --disconnect-on-expired-password 
 This variable controls how the server handles clients
 that are not aware of the sandbox mode. If enabled, the
 server disconnects the client, otherwise the server puts
 the client in a sandbox mode.
 --div-precision-increment=# 
 Precision of the result of '/' operator will be increased
 on that value
 --encrypt-binlog    Encrypt binary logs (including relay logs)
 --encrypt-tmp-disk-tables

 cache, etc)
 --enforce-storage-engine=name 
 Force the use of a storage engine for new tables
 --eq-range-index-dive-limit=#

 of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
 equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
 this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.
 --event-scheduler[=name] 
 Enable the event scheduler. Possible values are ON, OFF,
 and DISABLED (keep the event scheduler completely
 deactivated, it cannot be activated run-time)
 --expensive-subquery-limit=# 
 The maximum number of rows a subquery may examine in
 order to be executed during optimization and used for
 constant optimization
 --expire-logs-days=# 
 If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
 expire_logs_days days; It and binlog_expire_logs_seconds
 are linked, such that changes in one are converted into
 the other, presentable as a decimal value with 1/1000000
 of the day precision; possible purges happen at startup
 and at binary log rotation
 --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp 
 This option causes CREATE TABLE to create all TIMESTAMP
 columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
 option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
 DEFAULT clauses.
 --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
 With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test
 (not repair) tables while the MySQL server is running.
 Disable with --skip-external-locking.
 --extra-max-connections=# 
 The number of connections on extra-port
 --extra-port=#      Extra port number to use for tcp connections in a
 one-thread-per-connection manner. 0 means don't use

 GROUP_CONCAT()
 --gtid-cleanup-batch-size=# 
 Normally does not need tuning. How many old rows must
 accumulate in the mysql.gtid_slave_pos table before a
 background job will be run to delete them. Can be
 increased to reduce number of commits if using many
 different engines with --gtid_pos_auto_engines, or to
 reduce CPU overhead if using a huge number of different
 gtid_domain_ids. Can be decreased to reduce number of old
 rows in the table.
 --gtid-domain-id=#  Used with global transaction ID to identify logically
 independent replication streams. When events can
 propagate through multiple parallel paths (for example
 multiple masters), each independent source server must
 use a distinct domain_id. For simple tree-shaped
 replication topologies, it can be left at its default, 0.
 --gtid-ignore-duplicates 
 When set, different master connections in multi-source
 replication are allowed to receive and process event
 groups with the same GTID (when using GTID mode). Only
 one will be applied, any others will be ignored. Within a
 given replication domain, just the sequence number will
 be used to decide whether a given GTID has been already
 applied; this means it is the responsibility of the user
 to ensure that GTID sequence numbers are strictly
 increasing.
 --gtid-pos-auto-engines=name 
 List of engines for which to automatically create a
 mysql.gtid_slave_pos_ENGINE table, if a transaction using
 that engine is replicated. This can be used to avoid
 introducing cross-engine transactions, if engines are
 used different from that used by table
 mysql.gtid_slave_pos
 --gtid-strict-mode  Enforce strict seq_no ordering of events in the binary
 log. Slave stops with an error if it encounters an event
 that would cause it to generate an out-of-order binlog if
 executed.

 Don't overwrite stale .MYD and .MYI even if no directory
 is specified
 --key-buffer-size=# The size of the buffer used for index blocks for MyISAM
 tables. Increase this to get better index handling (for
 all reads and multiple writes) to as much as you can
 afford
 --key-cache-age-threshold=# 
 This characterizes the number of hits a hot block has to
 be untouched until it is considered aged enough to be
 downgraded to a warm block. This specifies the percentage
 ratio of that number of hits to the total number of
 blocks in key cache

 The default size of key cache blocks
 --key-cache-division-limit=# 
 The minimum percentage of warm blocks in key cache

 probably 1/10 of number of possible open MyISAM files.
 --key-cache-segments=# 
 The number of segments in a key cache
 -L, --language=name Client error messages in given language. May be given as
 a full path. Deprecated. Use --lc-messages-dir instead.

 --pid-file
 --log-bin[=name]    Log update queries in binary format. Optional argument
 should be name for binary log. If not given
 'datadir'/'log-basename'-bin or 'datadir'/mysql-bin will
 be used (the later if --log-basename is not specified).
 We strongly recommend to use either --log-basename or
 specify a filename to ensure that replication doesn't
 stop if the real hostname of the computer changes.
 --log-bin-compress  Whether the binary log can be compressed
 --log-bin-compress-min-len[=#] 
 Minimum length of sql statement(in statement mode) or
 record(in row mode)that can be compressed.

 used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
 allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
 if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
 logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
 ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues

 make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
 --replicate-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the

 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:

 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
 that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more

 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
 to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
 table names start with bar.
 --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master
 during slave registration. Will appear in the output of
 SHOW SLAVE HOSTS. Leave unset if you do not want the
 slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
 not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
 the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
 NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
 for connecting to the slave from the master or other
 hosts
 --report-password=name 
 The account password of the slave to be reported to the
 master during slave registration
 --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master

 idempotent. This means that CREATE TABLE is treated as
 CREATE TABLE OR REPLACE and DROP TABLE is treated as DROP
 TABLE IF EXISTS.
 --slave-domain-parallel-threads=# 
 Maximum number of parallel threads to use on slave for
 events in a single replication domain. When using
 multiple domains, this can be used to limit a single

 avoid any conflicts. "aggressive" tries to maximise the
 parallelism, possibly at the cost of increased conflict
 rate. "minimal" only parallelizes the commit steps of
 transactions. "none" disables parallel apply completely.
 --slave-parallel-threads=# 
 If non-zero, number of threads to spawn to apply in
 parallel events on the slave that were group-committed on

 created by a replication slave
 --slave-parallel-workers=# 
 Alias for slave_parallel_threads
 --slave-run-triggers-for-rbr=name 
 Modes for how triggers in row-base replication on slave
 side will be executed. Legal values are NO (default),
 YES, LOGGING and ENFORCE. NO means that trigger for RBR
 will not be running on slave. YES and LOGGING means that
 triggers will be running on slave, if there was not
 triggers running on the master for the statement. LOGGING
 also means results of that the executed triggers work
 will be written to the binlog. ENFORCE means that
 triggers will always be run on the slave, even if there
