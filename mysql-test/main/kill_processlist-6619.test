# The use of DEBUG_SYNC here is quite tricky, and there were several bugs in
# this test case before. The dispatch_command_end* sync points will trigger at
# the end of the statement that sets them, so we need to use EXECUTE 2/3 to
# make them trigger also during the "select 1" statement. And we need to use
# two separate sync points so that we can wait first and signal after;
# otherwise the last wait from dispatch_command_end may time out as its signal
# gets overridden from the later sync point "before_execute_sql_command".
