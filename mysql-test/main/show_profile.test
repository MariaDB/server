# Test for show profiles
# No meaningful check is possible. 
# So it only checks that SET profiling is possible and
# that SHOW PROFILES, SHOW PROFILE FOR QUERY and SHOW PROFILE CPU FOR QUERY
# do not cause syntax errors. It also increases code coverage for sql_profile.cc

# Tests will be skipped for the view protocol because the view protocol creates 
# an additional util connection and other statistics data
