# Tests of cost-based choice between the materialization and in-to-exists
# subquery execution strategies (MWL#89)
#
# The test file is divided into two groups of tests:
# A. Typical cases when either of the two strategies is selected:
#    1. Subquery in disjunctive WHERE clause of the outer query.
#    2. NOT IN subqueries
#    3. Subqueries with GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions
#    4. Subqueries in the SELECT and HAVING clauses
#    5. Subqueries with UNION
# B. Reasonably exhaustive tests of the various combinations of optimizer
#    switches, data distribution, available indexes, and typical queries.
