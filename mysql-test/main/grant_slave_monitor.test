# ==== Purpose ====
#
# SLAVE MONITOR privilege is required to execute following commands.
#   SHOW SLAVE STATUS
#   SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Step1: GRANT ALL privileges for a new user 'user1' and then REVOKE
#        SLAVE MONITOR and SUPER privileges.
# Step2: Execute SHOW SLAVE STAUTS/SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS commands and expect
#        ER_SPECIFIC_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR. This also verifies that REPLICATION
#        SLAVE ADMIN privilege is not required for these two commands.
# Step3: GRANT SLAVE MONITOR privilege and observe that both commands are
#        allowd to execute.
# Step4: GRANT SUPER privilege and observe that only SHOW SLAVE STATUS command
#        is allowed.
