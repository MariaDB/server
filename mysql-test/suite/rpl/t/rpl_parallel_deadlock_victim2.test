--echo *** MDEV-28776: rpl.rpl_mark_optimize_tbl_ddl fails with timeout on sync_with_master
# This was a failure where a transaction T1 could deadlock multiple times
# with T2, eventually exceeding the default --slave-transaction-retries=10.
# Root cause was MDEV-31655, causing InnoDB to wrongly choose T1 as deadlock
# victim over T2. If thread scheduling is right, it was possible for T1 to
# repeatedly deadlock, roll back, and have time to grab an S lock again before
# T2 woke up and got its waiting X lock, thus repeating the same deadlock over
# and over.
# Once the bug is fixed, it is not possible to re-create the same execution
# and thread scheduling. Instead we inject small sleeps in a way that
# triggered the problem when the bug was there, to demonstrate that the
# problem no longer occurs.
