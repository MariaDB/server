# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test verifies that failed CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE statement which
# dropped the table but failed at a later stage of creation of temporary table
# is written to binarylog in row based replication.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Steps:
#    0 - Have mixed based replication mode.
#    1 - Create a temporary table. It will be replicated as mixed replication
#        mode is in use.
#    2 - Execute an unsafe statement which will switch current statement
#        binlog format to 'ROW'. i.e If binlog_format=MIXED, there are open
#        temporary tables, and an unsafe statement is executed, then subsequent
#        statements are logged in row format.
#    3 - Execute a CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE statement which tries to
#        create partitions on temporary table. Since it is not supported it will
#        fail.
#    4 - Check the binary log output to ensure that the failed statement is
#        written to the binary log.
#    5 - Slave should be up and running and in sync with master.
