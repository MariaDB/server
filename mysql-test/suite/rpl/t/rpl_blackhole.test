# PURPOSE. Test that blackhole works with replication in all three
# modes: STATEMENT, MIXED, and ROW.
#
# METHOD. We start by creating a table on the master and then change
# the engine to use blackhole on the slave.
#
# After insert/update/delete of one or more rows, the test the
# proceeds to check that replication is running after replicating an
# change, that the blackhole engine does not contain anything (which
# is just a check that the correct engine is used), and that something
# is written to the binary log.
#
# Whe check INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statement for tables with no
# key (forcing a range search on the slave), primary keys (using a
# primary key lookup), and index/key with multiple matches (forcing an
# index search).
