# This test is to make sure that slaves can read a binlog containing
# table map ids stored in 4 bytes, even though we now store them in 6
# bytes. This is for backward-compatibility.
# If the slave does not detect that the master stores the table map id
# in 4 bytes, slave will read 6 bytes, and so will read the 2 bytes of
# flags at the place where there actually is data, so the test should
# fail.
