#
# Purpose:
#   This test validates that a slave's relay log format description event is
# not used to calculate the Seconds_Behind_Master time displayed by
# SHOW SLAVE STATUS.
#
# Methodology:
#   Ensure that a slave's reported Seconds_Behind_Master does not point before
# a time in which we can prove that it has progressed beyond. The slave's
# relay log events are created using the timestamp at which the IO thread was
# created. Therefore, after starting the slave's IO thread, we sleep so any
# proceeding events are forced to have later timestamps. After sleeping, we run
# MDL statements on the master and save the time at which they are binlogged.
# Once the slave executes these MDL commands, we have proven that the slave has
# caught up to this saved timestamp. At this point, if the value of
# Seconds_Behind_Master points before the time in which the MDL events were
# logged, it is invalid.
#

#   MDEV-16091: Seconds_Behind_Master spikes to millions of seconds
