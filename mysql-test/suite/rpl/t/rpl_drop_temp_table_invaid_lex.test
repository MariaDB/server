# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test verifies that no ASAN issues are reported at the time of writing DROP
# TEMPORARY TABLE statements to binary log as part of session cleanup.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Steps:
#    1 - Create a new connection named 'con1'.
#    2 - Create a temporary table named 'tmp' as part of connection 'con1'.
#    3 - Try to disconnect the current session when a CREATE .. SELECT
#        statement is in the middle of execution.
#    4 - Observe that no ASAN issue is reported.
