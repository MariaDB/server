# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test verifies that, due to a temporary network error, if request dump
# command specific packet write operation fails then the write error gets
# handled appropriately. Further retry will be initiated with appropriate
# slave registration on master. This will ensure that master has all the
# details of slave and no warnings are reported on the master side.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Steps:
#    0 - Skip the slave start.
#    1 - Enable debug simulation which will simulate packet write error during
#        dump request command execution.
#    2 - Start the slave. Observe that slave is able to reconnect post
#        temporary network write error.
