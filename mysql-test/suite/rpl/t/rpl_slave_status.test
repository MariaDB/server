# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that a slave without replication privileges has
# Slave_IO_Running = No
# Check that relay_log_status doesn't change by CHANGE MASTER
# ==== Method ====
#
# We do the following steps:
# - Create a new replication user on master
# - Connect to slave and start replication as this user.
# - Verify that slave can replicate well, by creating a table and
#   inserting a row into it.
# - Delete the user from the master.
# - Stop and start the slave (this should fail).
# - Check the Slave_IO_Running column of SHOW SLAVE STATUS.
#
