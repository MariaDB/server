# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test verifies that replication shouldn't hang when number of active threads
# on the slave server are less than the allowed innodb_thread_concurrency value.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Steps:
#    0 - Have master slave replication setup with engine being Innodb.
#    1 - Configure innodb_thread_concurrency = 100.
#    2 - Do some DML on master and sync the slave with master.
#    3 - Ensure replication doesn't hang.
