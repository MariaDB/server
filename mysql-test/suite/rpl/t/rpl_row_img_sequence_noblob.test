#
# Purpose:
#   The rpl_row_img_sequence group of tests verify that sequence MDL updates,
# i.e. NEXTVAL and SETVAL, respect the binlog_row_image variable value when
# written into the binary log. In particular, it ensures that only changed
# columns are written with MINIMAL image mode, and all columns are written
# otherwise. This test focuses on validating the behavior of
# binlog_row_img=NOBLOB.
#
# Methodology
#   After issuing a sequence update, ensure that both 1) it was replicated
# correctly, and 2) it was binlogged respective to the binlog_row_image value.
# The sequence table does not use caching to ensure each update is immediately
# binlogged. Each command is binlogged into its own unique log file, and the
# entirety of the file is analyzed for correctness of its sequence event.
# Specifically, mysqlbinlog is used in verbose mode so it outputs the columns
# which belong to the event, and the columns are analyzed to ensure the correct
# ones were logged. rpl_row_img_general_loop.inc is used to test with multiple
# chained replicas, varying engines between InnoDB and MyISAM.
