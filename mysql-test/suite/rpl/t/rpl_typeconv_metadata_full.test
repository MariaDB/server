# Variant of rpl_typeconv.test to ensure that basic type conversions work when
# using field name lookups (i.e. binlog_row_metadata=FULL). The behavior should
# be exactly the same as rpl_typeconv.test, as there is no different ordering
# of columns. This simply ensures that binlog_row_metadata=FULL doesn't break
# existing, expected behavior.
