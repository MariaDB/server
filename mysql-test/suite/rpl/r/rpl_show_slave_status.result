[connection master]
*
* The purpose of this test is to prevent incorrect additions to SHOW
* SLAVE STATUS, which has happened several times in the past.
*
* We must never, _ever_, add extra rows to this output of SHOW SLAVE
* STATUS, except at the very end, as this breaks backwards compatibility
* with applications or scripts that parse the output. This also means that
* we cannot add _any_ new rows in a GA version if a different row was
* already added in a later MariaDB version, as this would make it impossible
* to merge the change up while preserving the order of rows.
