column_name	column_comment
EVENT_NAME	Event name. Used together with OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN for grouping events.
OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN	If an instrument creates multiple instances, each instance has a unique OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN value to allow for grouping by instance.
COUNT_STAR	Number of summarized events
SUM_TIMER_WAIT	Total wait time of the summarized events that are timed.
MIN_TIMER_WAIT	Minimum wait time of the summarized events that are timed.
AVG_TIMER_WAIT	Average wait time of the summarized events that are timed.
MAX_TIMER_WAIT	Maximum wait time of the summarized events that are timed.
