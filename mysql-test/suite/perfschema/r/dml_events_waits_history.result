END_EVENT_ID	NULL when the event starts, set to the thread's current event number at the end of the event.
EVENT_NAME	Event instrument name and a NAME from the setup_instruments table
SOURCE	Name and line number of the source file containing the instrumented code that produced the event.
TIMER_START	Value in picoseconds when the event timing started or NULL if timing is not collected.
TIMER_END	Value in picoseconds when the event timing ended, or NULL if the event has not ended or timing is not collected.
TIMER_WAIT	Value in picoseconds of the event's duration or NULL if the event has not ended or timing is not collected.
SPINS	Number of spin rounds for a mutex, or NULL if spin rounds are not used, or spinning is not instrumented.
