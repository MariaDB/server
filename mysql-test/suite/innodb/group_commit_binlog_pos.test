# XtraDB stores the binlog position corresponding to the last commit, and
# prints it during crash recovery.
# Test that we get the correct position when we group commit several
# transactions together.

# What we really want to test here is what happens when a group of
# transactions get written only partially to disk inside InnoDB before
# the crash. But that is hard to test in mysql-test-run automated
# tests. Instead, we use debug_sync to tightly control when each
# transaction is written to the redo log. And we set
# innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=3 so that we can write out
# transactions individually - as with
# innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1, all commits are written together,
# as part of a commit_checkpoint.
# (Note that we do not have to restore innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit, as
# we crash the server).
