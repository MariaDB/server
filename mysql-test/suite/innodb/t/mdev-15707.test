# Deadlock in conjunction with the innodb change buffering.

# When innodb change buffering kicks in, i.e secondary non-unique index
# does not fit into the bufferpool, then, on Windows, innodb
# background threads could deadlock whenever index page is
# read, and the page needs load/merge change buffer.
# The test tries to reproduce this situation, by creating index
# that does not fit into bufferpool, and doing a large update.
