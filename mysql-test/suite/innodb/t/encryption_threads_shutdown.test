# If the bug is not fixed, the server will hang here. Note that the test is
# unstable because the condition
# "srv_n_fil_crypt_threads_started != srv_n_fil_crypt_threads" can be true
# in fil_crypt_set_thread_cnt() functions if encryption threads have not yet
# been finished. To make the test stable we need to add debug code which would
# check that all encryption threads were finished before the "while" loop
# with the above condition. And in this test we can't detect if the  debug code
# itself caused the hang or the code we are testing did it.
