# This DELETE is locked by the previous DELETE, after that DELETE is
# committed, it will still be locked by the next INSERT on delete-marked
# heap_no 2 record. After that INSERT inserted the record with heap_no 3,
# and after heap_no 2 record is purged, this DELETE will be unlocked and
# must restore persistent cursor position at heap_no 3 record, as it has the
# same secondary key value as former heap_no 2 record. Then it must be blocked
# by the previous INSERT, and after the INSERT is committed, it must
# delete the record, inserted by the previous INSERT, and the last INSERT(see
# below) must be finished without error. But instead this DELETE restores
# persistent cursor position to supremum, as a result, it does not delete the
# record, inserted by the previous INSERT, and the last INSERT is finished with
# duplicate key check error.
