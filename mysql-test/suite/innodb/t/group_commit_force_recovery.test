# MDEV-24302 RESET MASTER hangs as Innodb does not report on binlog checkpoint
# Testing binlog checkpoint notification works under stringent condition
# set by innodb_force_recovery = 2.

--source include/have_innodb.inc
--source include/have_binlog_format_mixed.inc

# Binlog checkpoint notification consumers such as RESET MASTER
# receive one when lsn_0 at the time of the request is finally gets flushed
#   flush_lsn >= lsn_0
# The bug situation was that when lsn_0 reflects a write of an internal innodb trx
# and RESET MASTER was not followed by any more user transaction
# it would hang.

CREATE TABLE t1(a int) ENGINE=InnoDB;
INSERT INTO t1 SET a=1;
RESET MASTER;

# final cleanup
DROP TABLE t1;
--echo End of the tests.
