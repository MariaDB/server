# Purge can cause deadlock in the test, requesting page's RW_X_LATCH for trx
# ids reseting, after trx 2 acqured RW_S_LATCH and suspended in debug sync point
# lock_trx_handle_wait_enter, waiting for upd_cont signal, which must be
# emitted after the last SELECT in this test. The last SELECT will hang waiting
# for purge RW_X_LATCH releasing, and trx 2 will be rolled back by timeout.

# There is deadlock_report_before_lock_releasing sync point in
# Deadlock::report(), which is waiting for sel_cont signal under
# lock_sys_t lock. The signal must be issued after "UPDATE t SET b = 100"
# rollback, and that rollback is executing undo record, which is blocked on
# dict_sys latch request. dict_sys is locked by the thread of statistics
# update(dict_stats_save()), and during that update lock_sys lock is requested,
# and can't be acquired as Deadlock::report() holds it. We have to disable
# statistics update to make the test stable.
