# solely to prove the RC isolation yields ROW binlog format as it is
# supposed to:
# https://mariadb.com/kb/en/unsafe-statements-for-statement-based-replication/#isolation-levels.
# The original MDEV-30225 test is adapted to the RC to create
# a similar sophisticated scenario which does not lead to any deadlock though.
