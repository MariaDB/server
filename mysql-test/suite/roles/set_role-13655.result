# MDEV-13655: SET ROLE does not properly grant privileges.

# We must test that if aditional db privileges get granted to a role
# which previously inherited privileges from another granted role
# keep the internal memory structures intact.

# First we create an entry with privileges for databases for the simple role.
#

#
# Now we grant the simple role to admin. This means that db privileges
# should propagate to admin.
