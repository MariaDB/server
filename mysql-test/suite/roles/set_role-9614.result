# MDEV-9614 Roles and Users Longer than 6 characters
#
# This test case checks the edge case presented in the MDEV. The
# real issue is actually apparent when the username is longer than the
# rolename.
#
# We need a separate database not including test or test_% names. Due to
# default privileges given on these databases.
