#
# This test checks that innodb_disallow_writes works as expected
#
# Note that we need to enable binlog for this test: If the commit
# to InnoDB is done in one phase, the transaction is committed in
# memory before it is persisted to disk. This means that the
# innodb_disallow_writes=ON may not prevent transaction to
# become visible to other readers. On the other hand, if the
# commit is two phase (as it is with binlog), the transaction
# will be blocked in prepare phase.
