#
# Test scenario:
#
# Run an autocommit INSERT and stop the execution after the INSERT
# has released commit order critical section. On another connection,
# run SR transaction which will store one fragment into streaming log.
# If the bug is present, the fragment streaming log commit may
# out of order, and completing INSERT may cause assertion in debug build.
#
# Note that due to nature of this bug, it is may not be possible
# to construct fully deterministic test case which will crash the
# server each time if the bug is present, but will work with fix.
