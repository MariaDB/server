# Testing CREATE TABLE statement having foreign key constraint,
# while having concurrent DML for the referenced parent table.
#
# The replication of CREATE TABLE should have all referenced table names
# appended in the key set, and DML on the parent table should be considered as
# conflicting.
# 
# There are related test scenarios in test mysql-wsrep#332, where a regular table
# is altered by adding new foreign key reference.
#
# We use concurrency facility of test MW-369 to setup the conflict between DDL and DML
#

# Open connection node_1a here, MW-369.inc will use it later

# create FK parent table
