#
# Test A Outline:
# ===============
#
# This test tests the scenario for MW-369 where a new child table
# row referring to parent table row is inserted concurrently from
# another node while the transaction which tries to delete a
# referred row from the parent table is committing.
#
# The pa table will originally have rows (1, 0), (2, 0).
# The ca table will be empty.
#
# A new row (1, 1) pointing to parent row (1, 0) is inserted from
# connection node_2, the transaction which tries to remove the
# parent row (1, 0) is run from connection node_1.
#
# Expected outcome:
# ================
#
# The transaction on node_1 will fail. The parent table will contain
# rows (1, 0), (2, 0) and the child table will contain row (1, 1).

#
# Test D Outline:
# ===============
#
# This test is similar to test A, where parent row is deleted while a child row
# is inserted simultaneously on node 2. However, in this test case the FK
# constraint's target column is a unique key, and parent row is not delete,
# but this key value is changed so that insert on node 2 will cause FK
# violation
#
# The pd table will originally have rows (1, 0)
# The cd table will originally be empty
#
# in node_1, parent row is updated to value (1,1)
# A row (1, 0) pointing to the old version of parent row (1, 0) is inserted
# in connection node_2
#
# Expected Outcome:
# ================
# This is a true conflict and one transaciton must abort. In this case it is
# node_1 transaction, which was scheduled later.
#    Parent table should have row (1,0)
#    child table should have row (1,0)

#
# Test E Outline:
# ===============
#
# This test is similar to test B, where parent row is deleted while a child row
# is updated simultaneously on node 2. However, in this test case the FK
# constraint has ON DELETE CASCADE option, and the delete on parent row will
# cascade a delete on child row as well. This will cause true conflict with 
# connection node_2, which tries to update unrelated column on child table.
#
# The pe table will originally have rows (1, 0), (2,0)
# The ce table will originally have row (1,1,0)
#
# in node_1, parent row (1,0) is deleted and cascaded delete will happen on
# child table row (1,1,0).
# in connection node_2 child table row is update to value (1,1,1)
#
# Expected Outcome:
# ================
# This is a true conflict and one transaciton must abort. In this case it is node_1
# transaction, which was scheduled later.
#    Parent table should have rows (1,0), (2,0)
#    child table should have row (1,1,1)

# Test F Outline:
# ===============
#
# Test two concurrent INSERTs on the child table.
#
# The pf table will originally have row (1)
# The cf table will originally be empty
#
# A new row (10, 1) pointing to parent row (1) is inserted from
# connection node_2. A transaction which tries to INSERT another child
# row (20, 1), pointing to the same parent, is run from connection node_1.
#
# Expected Outcome:
# =================
# Both INSERTs should succeed since they don't modify the common parent
# key.
#
# At the end of the test:
#    parent table should have row (1)
#    child table should have rows (10, 1), (20, 1)

# and UPDATE to parent row does not touch the foreign key referenced by the
# child row INSERT. The parent table shall contain rows (1, 1), (2, 0).
