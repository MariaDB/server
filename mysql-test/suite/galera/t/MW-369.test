# Test A Outline:
# ===============
#
# This test tests the scenario for MW-369 where a new child table
# row referring to parent table row is inserted concurrently from
# another node while the transaction which tries to delete a
# referred row from the parent table is committing.
#
# The p table will originally have rows (1, 0), (2, 0).
# The c table will be empty.
#
# A new row (1, 1) pointing to parent row (1, 0) is inserted from
# connection node_2, the transaction which tries to remove the
# parent row (1, 0) is run from connection node_1.
#
# Expected outcome:
# ================
#
# The transaction on node_1 will fail. The parent table will contain
# rows (1, 0), (2, 0) and the child table will contain row (1, 1).

#    child table should have row (1,0)

# Test E Outline:

#
# This test is similar to test B, where parent row is deleted while a child row
# is updated simultaneously on node 2. However, in this test case the FK
# constraint has ON DELETE CASCADE option, and the delete on parent row will
# cascade a delete on child row as well. This will cause true conflict with 
# connection node_2, which tries to update unrelated column on child table.
#
# The p table will originally have rows (1, 0), (2,0)
# The c table will originally have row (1,1,0)
#
# in node_1, parent row (1,0) is deleted and cascaded delete will happen on
# child table row (1,1,0).

#
# The pf table will originally have row (1)
# The cf table will originally be empty
#
# A new row (10, 1) pointing to parent row (1) is inserted from
