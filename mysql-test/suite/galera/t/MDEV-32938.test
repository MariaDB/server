#
# MDEV-32938: ALTER command is replicated and successfully applied while being BF-aborted locally.
#
# Why it happend:
# - ALTER went to prepare FK-referenced tables as TOI keys
# - to do this, it would open the main table with SHARED_HIGH_PRIO MDL lock which disregarded any
#   other locks (including X-lock) waiting in the queue in case someone was already holding a
#   compatible lock type (like any DML operation)
# - if there was other TOI operation on the same table, it would go through BF-abort cycle to grab
#   the lock for itself
# - since the initial ALTER had not reached TOI yet, it would loose to real TOI operation and got
#   BF-aborted with its THD marked as killed
# - then, ALTER would enter TOI and get replicated with no checks that it has already been aborted
# - after entering TOI mode, it would later find it'd been killed, and complete with an error
# - at the same time, the command would successfully apply on every other node except the initiator.
#
#
# NOTE : After MDL-lock conflict resolution rework this test behaviour has
# changed.
