# Bug 35333 "If a Federated table can't connect to the remote hose, can't retrieve metadata"
#
# Queries such as SHOW TABLE STATUS and SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES fail
# when encountering a federated table that cannot connect to its remote table.
#
# The fix is to store the error text in the TABLE COMMENTS column of I_S.TABLES, clear
# the remote connection error and push a warning instead. This allows the SELECT operation
# to complete while still indicating a problem. This fix applies to any non-fatal system
# error that occurs during a query against I_S.TABLES.de
