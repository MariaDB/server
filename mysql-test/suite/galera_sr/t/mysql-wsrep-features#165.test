# This test attempts to catch a race condition between autocommit
# transaction and transaction which is rolling back due to
# deadlock.
#
# Since it is trying to catch a race condition which may not reliably
# occur, several runs are necessary for certainty. Hence the body of
# the test was placed into the .inc file and sourced several times below
#
# Test outline:
# * Trx 1a makes updates
# * SR trx 1b writes a row 3, then makes updates
# * AC trx 1c will attempt to write row 3 and will wait for lock
#   held by 1b
# * Sync point is set for 1b to delay SR rollback
# * SR trx 1b makes an update which makes it conflict with trx 1a
# * Slave shows BF - BF conflict and fails in applying write event
