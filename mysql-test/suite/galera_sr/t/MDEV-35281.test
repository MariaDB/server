# MDEV-35281 - SR transaction crashes with innodb_snapshot_isolation
#
# Test outline: a simple SR transaction fails to remove
# its fragments from streaming_log table, with error
# HA_ERR_RECORD_CHANGED.
# This happens with the following sequence of events:
# 1. Start a streaming replication transaction
# 2. The transaction creates a read view in InnoDB
#    (this must happen before a fragment is replicated)
# 3. The transaction replicates a fragment.
#    Internally, a new transaction is created to INSERT
#    a row representing the fragment into the streaming_log
#    table and is committed immediately.
# 4. The streaming replication transaction COMMITs.
#    Before committing, the transaction replicates
#    a commit fragment and DELETEs its fragments that
#    were created in the streaming_log table.
#    If bug is present, fragment removal from the
#    streaming_log table violates snapshot isolation,
#    thus the operation fails with HA_ERR_RECORD_CHANGED.
#    (One or more records from the streaming_log table
#    are removed, while these were not visible to
#    the transaction).
