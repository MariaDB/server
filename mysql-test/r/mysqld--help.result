--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.

 --allow-suspicious-udfs 
 Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
 without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
 also means that one can load any function from any
 library, for example exit() from libc.so
 -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
 --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
 Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
 --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
 Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
 auto-increment-increment != 1
 --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
 --automatic-sp-privileges 
 Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
 --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MariaDB can
 have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
 gets very many connection requests in a very short time
 (Automatically configured unless set explicitly)

 resolved relative to this
 --big-tables        Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on
 file (Solves most 'table full' errors)

 --binlog-annotate-row-events 
 Tells the master to annotate RBR events with the
 statement that caused these events
 --binlog-cache-size=# 
 The size of the transactional cache for updates to
 transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
 use transactions containing many statements, you can
 increase this to get more performance
 --binlog-checksum=name 
 Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
 events in the binary log. One of: NONE, CRC32
 --binlog-commit-wait-count=# 
 If non-zero, binlog write will wait at most
 binlog_commit_wait_usec microseconds for at least this
 many commits to queue up for group commit to the binlog.
 This can reduce I/O on the binlog and provide increased
 opportunity for parallel apply on the slave, but too high
 a value will decrease commit throughput.
 --binlog-commit-wait-usec=# 
 Maximum time, in microseconds, to wait for more commits
 to queue up for binlog group commit. Only takes effect if
 the value of binlog_commit_wait_count is non-zero.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log.
 Before using this option make sure that there are no
 dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
 tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
 SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
 from the master.
 --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
 database, and exclude all others not explicitly
 mentioned.
 --binlog-format=name 
 What form of binary logging the master will use: either
 ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
 statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
 statement-based binary logging except for those
 statements where only row-based is correct: those which
 involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
 function; for those, row-based binary logging is
 automatically used.
 --binlog-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the master that updates to the given database
 should not be logged to the binary log.
 --binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling 
 Run fast part of group commit in a single thread, to
 optimize kernel thread scheduling. On by default. Disable
 to run each transaction in group commit in its own
 thread, which can be slower at very high concurrency.
 This option is mostly for testing one algorithm versus
 the other, and it should not normally be necessary to
 change it.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling to disable.)
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
 The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
 --binlog-row-image=name 
 Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
 'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
 columns in the before and after image are logged.
 'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
 whenever possible (eg, blob column was not changed or is
 not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
 equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
 the table) is logged in the before image, and only
 changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
 FULL).
 --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
 The size of the statement cache for updates to
 non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
 often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
 can increase this to get more performance

 columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
 option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
 DEFAULT clauses. The old behavior is deprecated.
 --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
 With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test
 (not repair) tables while the MySQL server is running.
 Disable with --skip-external-locking.

 The maximum length of the result of function 
 GROUP_CONCAT()
 --gtid-domain-id=#  Used with global transaction ID to identify logically
 independent replication streams. When events can
 propagate through multiple parallel paths (for example
 multiple masters), each independent source server must
 use a distinct domain_id. For simple tree-shaped
 replication topologies, it can be left at its default, 0.
 --gtid-ignore-duplicates 
 When set, different master connections in multi-source
 replication are allowed to receive and process event
 groups with the same GTID (when using GTID mode). Only
 one will be applied, any others will be ignored. Within a
 given replication domain, just the sequence number will
 be used to decide whether a given GTID has been already
 applied; this means it is the responsibility of the user
 to ensure that GTID sequence numbers are strictly
 increasing.
 --gtid-strict-mode  Enforce strict seq_no ordering of events in the binary
 log. Slave stops with an error if it encounters an event
 that would cause it to generate an out-of-order binlog if

 The default size of key cache blocks
 --key-cache-division-limit=# 
 The minimum percentage of warm blocks in key cache

 File that holds the names for last binary log files.
 --log-bin-trust-function-creators 
 If set to FALSE (the default), then when --log-bin is
 used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
 allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
 if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
 logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
 ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
 do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
 can safely set this to TRUE
 --log-error[=name]  Log errors to file (instead of stdout).  If file name is

 Meaning: 1 - use selectivity of index backed range
 conditions to calculate the cardinality of a partial join
 if the last joined table is accessed by full table scan
 or an index scan, 2 - use selectivity of index backed

 use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
 Note that this will only work if you do not use
 cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table

 --replicate-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
 table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
 directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
 work for cross-database updates, in contrast to

 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
 that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
 than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for

 replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
 to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
 table names start with bar.

 slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
 not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
 the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
 NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
 for connecting to the slave from the master or other
 hosts
 --report-password=name 
 The account password of the slave to be reported to the
 master during slave registration
 --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master

 as many threads as it wants, up to the value of
 slave_parallel_threads.
 --slave-exec-mode=name 
 How replication events should be executed. Legal values
 are STRICT (default) and IDEMPOTENT. In IDEMPOTENT mode,
 replication will not stop for operations that are

 parallel, and handles any conflicts with rollback and
 retry. "conservative" limits parallelism in an effort to
 avoid any conflicts. "aggressive" tries to maximise the
 parallelism, possibly at the cost of increased conflict
 rate. "minimal" only parallelizes the commit steps of
 transactions. "none" disables parallel apply completely.
 --slave-parallel-threads=# 
 If non-zero, number of threads to spawn to apply in
 parallel events on the slave that were group-committed on

 created by a replication slave
 --slave-parallel-workers=# 
 Alias for slave_parallel_threads
 --slave-run-triggers-for-rbr=name 
 Modes for how triggers in row-base replication on slave
 side will be executed. Legal values are NO (default), YES
 and LOGGING. NO means that trigger for RBR will not be
 running on slave. YES and LOGGING means that triggers
 will be running on slave, if there was not triggers
 running on the master for the statement. LOGGING also
 means results of that the executed triggers work will be
 written to the binlog.
 --slave-skip-errors=name 
 Tells the slave thread to continue replication when a
 query event returns an error from the provided list
