Windows bug: new line disappears when it is exactly at the right offset.
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults Don't read default options from any option file.
The following specify which files/extra groups are read (specified before remaining options):
--defaults-file=# Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=# Additionally read default groups with # appended as a suffix.

 --allow-suspicious-udfs 
 Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
 without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
 also means that one can load any function from any
 library, for example exit() from libc.so
 -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
 --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
 Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
 --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
 Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
 auto-increment-increment != 1
 --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
 --automatic-sp-privileges 
 Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
 --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MariaDB can
 have. This comes into play when the main MariaDB thread
 gets very many connection requests in a very short time
 (Automatically configured unless set explicitly)
 -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
 resolved relative to this
 --big-tables        Old variable, which if set to 1, allows large result sets
 by saving all temporary sets to disk, avoiding 'table
 full' errors. No longer needed, as the server now handles
 this automatically. sql_big_tables is a synonym.
 --bind-address=name IP address to bind to.
 --binlog-annotate-row-events 
 Tells the master to annotate RBR events with the
 statement that caused these events
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-annotate-row-events to disable.)
 --binlog-cache-size=# 
 The size of the transactional cache for updates to
 transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
 use transactions containing many statements, you can
 increase this to get more performance
 --binlog-checksum=name 
 Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
 events in the binary log. One of: NONE, CRC32
 --binlog-commit-wait-count=# 
 If non-zero, binlog write will wait at most
 binlog_commit_wait_usec microseconds for at least this
 many commits to queue up for group commit to the binlog.
 This can reduce I/O on the binlog and provide increased
 opportunity for parallel apply on the slave, but too high
 a value will decrease commit throughput.
 --binlog-commit-wait-usec=# 
 Maximum time, in microseconds, to wait for more commits
 to queue up for binlog group commit. Only takes effect if
 the value of binlog_commit_wait_count is non-zero.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log.
 Before using this option make sure that there are no
 dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
 tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
 SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
 from the master.
 --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
 database, and exclude all others not explicitly
 mentioned.
 --binlog-format=name 
 What form of binary logging the master will use: either
 ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
 statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
 statement-based binary logging except for those
 statements where only row-based is correct: those which
 involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
 function; for those, row-based binary logging is
 automatically used.
 --binlog-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the master that updates to the given database
 should not be logged to the binary log.
 --binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling 
 Run fast part of group commit in a single thread, to
 optimize kernel thread scheduling. On by default. Disable
 to run each transaction in group commit in its own
 thread, which can be slower at very high concurrency.
 This option is mostly for testing one algorithm versus
 the other, and it should not normally be necessary to
 change it.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling to disable.)
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
 The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
 --binlog-row-image=name 
 Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
 'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
 columns in the before and after image are logged.
 'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
 whenever possible (eg, blob column was not changed or is
 not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
 equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
 the table) is logged in the before image, and only
 changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
 FULL).
 --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
 The size of the statement cache for updates to
 non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
 often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
 can increase this to get more performance.
 --bootstrap         Used by mysql installation scripts.
 --bulk-insert-buffer-size=# 
 Size of tree cache used in bulk insert optimisation. Note
 that this is a limit per thread!
 --character-set-client-handshake

 The default week format used by WEEK() functions
 --delay-key-write[=name] 
 Specifies how MyISAM tables handles CREATE TABLE
 DELAY_KEY_WRITE. If set to ON, the default, any DELAY KEY
 WRITEs are honored. The key buffer is then flushed only
 when the table closes, speeding up writes. MyISAM tables
 should be automatically checked upon startup in this
 case, and --external locking should not be used, as it
 can lead to index corruption. If set to OFF, DELAY KEY
 WRITEs are ignored, while if set to ALL, all new opened
 tables are treated as if created with DELAY KEY WRITEs
 enabled.
 --delayed-insert-limit=# 
 After inserting delayed_insert_limit rows, the INSERT
 DELAYED handler will check if there are any SELECT
 statements pending. If so, it allows these to execute
 before continuing.
 --delayed-insert-timeout=# 
 How long a INSERT DELAYED thread should wait for INSERT
 statements before terminating
 --delayed-queue-size=#

 Force the use of a storage engine for new tables
 --eq-range-index-dive-limit=# 
 The optimizer will use existing index statistics instead
 of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
 equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
 this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.
 --event-scheduler[=name] 
 Enable the event scheduler. Possible values are ON, OFF,
 and DISABLED (keep the event scheduler completely
 deactivated, it cannot be activated run-time)
 --expensive-subquery-limit=# 
 The maximum number of rows a subquery may examine in
 order to be executed during optimization and used for
 constant optimization
 --expire-logs-days=# 
 If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
 expire_logs_days days; possible purges happen at startup
 and at binary log rotation
 --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp 
 This option causes CREATE TABLE to create all TIMESTAMP
 columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
 option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
 DEFAULT clauses. The old behavior is deprecated.
 --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
 With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test
 (not repair) tables while the MySQL server is running.
 Disable with --skip-external-locking.
 --extra-max-connections=#

 --group-concat-max-len=# 
 The maximum length of the result of function
 GROUP_CONCAT()
 --gtid-domain-id=#  Used with global transaction ID to identify logically
 independent replication streams. When events can
 propagate through multiple parallel paths (for example
 multiple masters), each independent source server must
 use a distinct domain_id. For simple tree-shaped
 replication topologies, it can be left at its default, 0.
 --gtid-ignore-duplicates 
 When set, different master connections in multi-source
 replication are allowed to receive and process event
 groups with the same GTID (when using GTID mode). Only
 one will be applied, any others will be ignored. Within a
 given replication domain, just the sequence number will
 be used to decide whether a given GTID has been already
 applied; this means it is the responsibility of the user
 to ensure that GTID sequence numbers are strictly
 increasing.
 --gtid-strict-mode  Enforce strict seq_no ordering of events in the binary
 log. Slave stops with an error if it encounters an event
 that would cause it to generate an out-of-order binlog if
 executed.

 all reads and multiple writes) to as much as you can
 afford
 --key-cache-age-threshold=# 
 This characterizes the number of hits a hot block has to
 be untouched until it is considered aged enough to be
 downgraded to a warm block. This specifies the percentage
 ratio of that number of hits to the total number of
 blocks in key cache

 The default size of key cache blocks
 --key-cache-division-limit=# 
 The minimum percentage of warm blocks in key cache
 --key-cache-file-hash-size=#

 you have a lot of MyISAM files open you should increase
 this for faster flush of changes. A good value is
 probably 1/10 of number of possible open MyISAM files.
 --key-cache-segments=# 
 The number of segments in a key cache

 If set to FALSE (the default), then when --log-bin is
 used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
 allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
 if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
 logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
 ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
 do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
 can safely set this to TRUE
 --log-error[=name]  Log errors to file (instead of stdout).  If file name is
 not specified then 'datadir'/'log-basename'.err or the

 --optimizer-search-depth=# 
 Maximum depth of search performed by the query optimizer.
 Values larger than the number of relations in a query
 result in better query plans, but take longer to compile

 automatically pick a reasonable value.
 --optimizer-selectivity-sampling-limit=#

 --replicate-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
 table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
 directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
 work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
 replicate-ignore-db.

 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for

 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
 that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
 than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
 to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
 table names start with bar.
 --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master
 during slave registration. Will appear in the output of

 slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
 not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
 the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
 NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
 for connecting to the slave from the master or other
 hosts
 --report-password=name 
 The account password of the slave to be reported to the
 master during slave registration
 --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master

 as many threads as it wants, up to the value of
 slave_parallel_threads.
 --slave-exec-mode=name

 parallelism, possibly at the cost of increased conflict
 rate. "minimal" only parallelizes the commit steps of
 transactions. "none" disables parallel apply completely.
 --slave-parallel-threads=# 
 If non-zero, number of threads to spawn to apply in
 parallel events on the slave that were group-committed on

 will be running on slave, if there was not triggers
 running on the master for the statement. LOGGING also
 means results of that the executed triggers work will be
 written to the binlog.
