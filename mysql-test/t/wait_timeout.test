# Last modification:
# 2009-01-19 H.Hunger Fix Bug#39108 main.wait_timeout fails sporadically
#                       - Increase wait timeout to 2 seconds
#                       - Eliminated the corresponding opt file,
#                         set global wait timeout within the test.
#                       - Replaced sleeps by wait condition
#                       - Minor improvements
