  @class TranxNodeAllocator

  This class provides memory allocating and freeing methods for
  TranxNode. The main target is performance.

  @section ALLOCATE How to allocate a node
    The pointer of the first node after 'last_node' in current_block is
    returned. current_block will move to the next free Block when all nodes of
    it are in use. A new Block is allocated and is put into the rear of the
    Block link table if no Block is free.

    The list starts up empty (ie, there is no allocated Block).

    After some nodes are freed, there probably are some free nodes before
    the sequence of the allocated nodes, but we do not reuse it. It is better
    to keep the allocated nodes are in the sequence, for it is more efficient
    for allocating and freeing TranxNode.

  @section FREENODE How to free nodes
    There are two methods for freeing nodes. They are free_all_nodes and
    free_nodes_before.

    'A Block is free' means all of its nodes are free.
    @subsection free_nodes_before
    As all allocated nodes are in the sequence, 'Before one node' means all
    nodes before given node in the same Block and all Blocks before the Block
    which containing the given node. As such, all Blocks before the given one
    ('node') are free Block and moved into the rear of the Block link table.
    The Block containing the given 'node', however, is not. For at least the
    given 'node' is still in use. This will waste at most one Block, but it is
    more efficient.
