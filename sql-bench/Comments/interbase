Running crash-me on Interbase:
I
-  got opensource version of interbase 6.0.1
   (both mode, classic and superserver),
-  set up DBD::InterBase from cpan,
-  created database "test" and set sql_dialect for that database to 3
-  executed crash-me for both interbase's models (classic and superserver).

There were some problems during the execution:
1) Sometimes client side got SIGSEGV , At that moment server side
   writes
        gds__alloc: non-positive size allocation request
  to log file.
  This problem has both models. I am not sure if it's interbase or
  DBD:InterBase problem (though DBD::InterBase made all necessary
  tests during the installation without any problem)
 
2) In "superserver" mode ibserver several times died (and ibguard restarted it)
