/*

  What rowid / primary filters are
  --------------------------------

  Consider a join query Q of the form
    SELECT * FROM T1, ... , Tk WHERE P.

  For any of the table reference Ti(Q) from the from clause of Q different
  rowid / primary key filters (pk-filters for short) can be built.
  A pk-filter F built for Ti(Q) is a set of rowids / primary keys of Ti
  F= {pk1,...,pkN} such that for any row r=r1||...||rk from the result set of Q
  ri's rowid / primary key pk(ri) is contained in F.

  When pk-filters are useful
  --------------------------

  If building a pk-filter F for Ti(Q )is not too costly and its cardinality #F
  is much less than the cardinality of T - #T then using the pk-filter when
  executing Q might be quite beneficial.

  Let r be a random row from Ti. Let s(F) be the probability that pk(r)
  belongs to F. Let BC(F) be the cost of building F.

  Suppose that the optimizer has chosen for Q a plan with this join order
  T1 => ... Tk and that the table Ti is accessed by a ref access using index I.
  Let K = {k1,...,kM} be the set of all rowid/primary keys values used to access
  rows of Ti when looking for matches in this table.to join Ti by index I.

  Let's assume that two set sets K and F are uncorrelated.  With this assumption
  if before accessing data from Ti by the rowid / primary key k we first
  check whether k is in F then we can expect saving on M*(1-s(S)) accesses of
  data rows from Ti. If we can guarantee that test whether k is in F is
  relatively cheap then we can gain a lot assuming that BC(F) is much less
  then the cost of fetching M*(1-s(S)) records from Ti and following
  evaluation of conditions pushed into Ti.

  Making pk-filter test cheap
  ---------------------------

  If the search structure to test whether an element is in F can be fully
  placed in RAM then this test is expected to be be much cheaper than a random
  access of a record from Ti. We'll consider two search structures for
  pk-filters: ordered array and bloom filter. Ordered array is easy to
  implement, but it's space consuming. If a filter contains primary keys
  then at least space for each primary key from the filter must be allocated
  in the search structure. On a the opposite a bloom filter requires a
  fixed number of bits and this number does not depend on the cardinality
  of the pk-filter (10 bits per element will serve pk-filter of any size).

/*

  How and when the optimizer builds and uses range rowid filters
  --------------------------------------------------------------

  1. In make_join_statistics()
       for each join table s
         after the call of get_quick_record_count()
           the TABLE::method init_cost_info_for_usable_range_rowid_filters()
           is called
           The method build an array of Range_rowid_filter_cost_info elements
           containing the cost info on possible range filters for s->table.
           The array is optimized for further usage.

  2. For each partial join order when the optimizer considers joining
     table s to this partial join
       In the function best_access_path()
       a. When evaluating a ref access r by index idx to join s
          the optimizer estimates the effect of usage of each possible
          range filter f and chooses one with the best gain. The gain
          is taken into account when the cost of thr ref access r is
          calculated. If it turns out that this is the best ref access
          to join s then the info about the chosen filter together
          with the info on r is remembered in the corresponding element
          of the array of POSITION structures.
          [We evaluate every pair (ref access, range_filter) rather then
           every pair (best ref access, range filter) because if the index
           ref_idx used for ref access r correlates with the index rf_idx
           used  by the filter f then the pair (r,f) is not evaluated
           at all as we don't know how to estimate the effect of correlation
           between ref_idx and rf_idx.]
       b. When evaluating the best range access to join table s the
          optimizer estimates the effect of usage of each possible
          range filter f and chooses one with the best gain.
          [Here we should have evaluated every pair (range access,
           range filter) as well, but it's not done yet.]

  3. When the cheapest execution plan has been chosen and after the
     call of JOIN::get_best_combination()
       The method JOIN::make_range_rowid_filters() is called
       For each range rowid filter used in the chosen execution plan
       the method creates a quick select object to be able to perform
       index range scan to fill the filter at the execution stage.
       The method also creates Range_rowid_filter objects that are
       used at the execution stage.

  4. Just before the execution stage
       The method JOIN::init_range_rowid_filters() is called.
       For each join table s that is to be accessed with usage of a range
       filter the method allocates containers for the range filter and
       it lets the engine know that the filter will be used when
       accessing s.

  5. At the execution stage
       In the function sub_select() just before the first access of a join
       table s employing a range filter
         The method JOIN_TAB::build_range_rowid_filter_if_needed() is called
         The method fills the filter using the quick select created by
         JOIN::make_range_rowid_filters().

  6. The accessed key tuples are checked against the filter within the engine
     using the info pushed into it.
