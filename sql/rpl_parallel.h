/*
  Structure used to keep track of the parallel replication of a batch of
  event-groups that group-committed together on the master.

  It is used to ensure that every event group in one batch has reached the
  commit stage before the next batch starts executing.

  Note the lifetime of this structure:

   - It is allocated when the first event in a new batch of group commits
     is queued, from the free list rpl_parallel_entry::gco_free_list.

   - The gco for the batch currently being queued is owned by
     rpl_parallel_entry::current_gco. The gco for a previous batch that has
     been fully queued is owned by the gco->prev_gco pointer of the gco for
     the following batch.

   - The worker thread waits on gco->COND_group_commit_orderer for
     rpl_parallel_entry::count_committing_event_groups to reach wait_count
     before starting; the first waiter links the gco into the next_gco
     pointer of the gco of the previous batch for signalling.

   - When an event group reaches the commit stage, it signals the
     COND_group_commit_orderer if its gco->next_gco pointer is non-NULL and
     rpl_parallel_entry::count_committing_event_groups has reached
     gco->next_gco->wait_count.

   - The gco lives until all its event groups have completed their commit.
     This is detected by rpl_parallel_entry::last_committed_sub_id being
     greater than or equal gco->last_sub_id. Once this happens, the gco is
     freed. Note that since update of last_committed_sub_id can happen
     out-of-order, the thread that frees a given gco can be for any later
     event group, not necessarily an event group from the gco being freed.
