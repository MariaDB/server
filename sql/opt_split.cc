  This file contains functions to support the splitting technique.
  This optimization technique can be applied to equi-joins involving
  materialized tables such as materialized views, materialized derived tables
  and materialized CTEs. The technique also could be applied to materialized
  semi-joins though the code below does not support this usage yet.

  Here are the main ideas behind this technique that we'll call SM optimization
  (SplitMaterialization).

  Consider the query
    SELECT t1.a, t.min
      FROM t1, (SELECT t2.a, MIN(t2.b) as min FROM t2 GROUP BY t2.a) t
    WHERE t1.a = t.a and t1.b < const

  Re-write the query into
    SELECT t1.a, t.min
      FROM t1, LATERAL (SELECT t2.a, MIN(t2.b) as min
                        FROM t2 WHERE t2.a = t1.a GROUP BY t2.a) t
    WHERE t1.b < const

  The execution of the original query (Q1) does the following:
    1. Executes the query in the specification of the derived table
       and puts the result set into a temporary table with an index
       on the first column.
    2. Joins t1 with the temporary table using the its index.

  The execution of the transformed query (Q1R) follows these steps:
    1. For each row of t1 where t1.b < const a temporary table
       containing all rows of of t2 with t2.a = t1.a is created
    2. If there are any rows in the temporary table aggregation
       is performed for them
    3. The result of the aggregation is joined with t1.

  The second execution can win if:
    a) There is an efficient way to select rows of t2 for which t2.a = t1.a
       (For example if there is an index on t2.a)
    and
    b) The number of temporary tables created for partitions
       is much smaller that the total number of partitions

  It should be noted that for the transformed query aggregation
  for a partition may be performed several times.

  As we can see the optimization basically splits table t2 into
  partitions and performs aggregation over each of them
  independently.

  If we have only one equi-join condition then we either push it as
  for Q1R or we don't. In a general case we may have much more options.
  Consider the query (Q3)
    SELECT
      FROM t1,t2 (SELECT t3.a, t3.b, MIN(t3.c) as min
                  FROM t3 GROUP BY a,b) t
    WHERE t.a = t1.a AND t.b = t2.b
          AND t1.c < c1 and t2.c < c2
          AND P(t1,t2);
  (P(t1,t2) designates  some additional conditions over columns of t1,t2).

  Assuming that there indexes on t3(a,b) and t3(b) here we have several
  reasonable options to push equi-join conditions into the derived.
  All these options should be taken into account when the optimizer
  evaluates different join orders. When the join order (t1,t,t2) is
  evaluated there is only one way of splitting : to push the condition
  t.a = t1.a into t. With the join order (t2,t,t1) only the condition
  t.b = t2.b can be pushed. When the join orders (t1,t2,t) and (t2,t1,t)
  are evaluated then the optimizer should consider pushing t.a = t1.a,
  t.b = t2.b and (t.a = t1.a AND t.b = t2.b) to choose the best condition
  for splitting. Apparently here last condition is the best one because
  it provides the miximum possible number of partitions.

  If we dropped the index on t3(a,b) and created the index on t3(a) instead
  then we would have two options for splitting: to push t.a = t1.a or to
  push t.b = t2.b. If the selectivity of the index t3(a) is better than
  the selectivity of t3(b) then the first option is preferred.

  Although the condition (t.a = t1.a AND t.b = t2.b) provides a better
  splitting than the condition t.a = t1.a the latter will be used for
  splitting if the execution plan with the join order (t1,t,t2) turns out
  to be the cheapest one. It's quite possible when the join condition
  P(t1,t2) has a bad selectivity.

  Whenever the optimizer evaluates the cost of using a splitting it
  compares it with the cost of materialization without splitting.

  If we just drop the index on t3(a,b) the chances that the splitting
  will be used becomes much lower but they still exists providing that
  the fanout of the partial join of t1 and t2 is small enough.
*/

/*
  Splitting can be applied to a materialized table specified by the query
  with post-join operations that require partitioning of the result set produced
  by the join expression used in the FROM clause the query such as GROUP BY
  operation and window function operation. In any of these cases the post-join
  operation can be executed independently for any partition only over the rows
  of this partition. Also if the set of all partitions is divided into disjoint
  subsets the operation can applied to each subset independently. In this case
  all rows are first partitioned into the groups each of which contains all the
  rows from the partitions belonging the same subset and then each group
  is subpartitioned into groups in the the post join operation.

  The set of all rows belonging to the union of several partitions is called
  here superpartition. If a grouping operation is defined by the list
  e_1,...,e_n then any set S = {e_i1,...,e_ik} can be used to devide all rows
  into superpartions such that for any two rows r1, r2  the following holds:
  e_ij(r1) = e_ij(r2) for each e_ij from S. We use the splitting technique
  only if S consists of references to colums  of the joined tables.
  For example if the GROUP BY list looks like this a, g(b), c we can consider
  applying the splitting technique to the superpartitions defined by {a,c},
  {a}, {c} (a and c here may be the references to the columns from different
  tables).
*/

 /*
   The following describes when and how the optimizer decides whether it
   makes sense to employ the splitting technique.

   1. For each instance of a materialized table (derived/view/CTE) it is
      checked that it is potentially splittable. Now it is done right after the
      execution plan for the select specifying this table has been chosen.

   2. Any potentially splittable materialized table T is subject to two-phase
      optimization. It means that the optimizer first builds the best execution
      plan for join that specifies T. Then the control is passed back to the
      optimization process of the embedding select Q. After the execution plan
      for Q has been chosen the optimizer finishes the optimization of the join
      specifying T.

   3. When the optimizer builds the container with the KEYUSE structures
      for the join of embedding select it detects the equi-join conditions
      PC that potentially could be pushed into a potentially splittable
      materialized table T. The collected information about such conditions
      is stored together with other facts on potential splittings for table T.

   4. When the optimizer starts looking for the best execution plan for the
      embedding select Q for each potentially splittable materialized table T
      it creates special KEYUSE structures for pushable equi-join conditions
      PC. These structures are used to add new elements to the container
      of KEYUSE structures built for T. The specifics of these elements is
      that they can be ebabled and disabled during the process of choosing
      the best plan for Q.

   5. When the optimizer extends a partial join order with a potentially
      splittable materialized table T (in function best_access_path) it
      first evaluates a new execution plan for the modified specification
      of T that adds all equi-join conditions that can be pushed with
      current join prefix to the WHERE conditions of the original
      specification of T. If the cost of the new plan is better than the
      the cost of the original materialized table then the optimizer
      prefers to use splitting for the current join prefix. As the cost
      of the plan depends only on the pushed conditions it makes sense
      to cache this plan for other prefixes.

   6. The optimizer takes into account the cost of splitting / materialization
      of a potentially splittable materialized table T as a startup cost
      to access table T.

   7. When the optimizer finally chooses the best execution plan for
      the embedding select Q and this plan prefers using splitting
      for table T with pushed equi-join conditions PC then the execution
      plan for the underlying join with these conditions is chosen for T.

  @brief
    Check whether this join is one for potentially splittable materialized table

  @details
    The function checks whether this join is for select that specifies
    a potentially splittable materialized table T. If so, the collected
    info on potential splittability of T is attached to the field spl_opt_info
    of the TABLE structure for T.

    The function returns a positive answer if the following holds:
    1. the optimizer switch 'split_materialized' is set 'on'
    2. the select owning this join specifies a materialized derived/view/cte T
    3. this is the only select in the specification of T
    4. condition pushdown is not prohibited into T
    5. T is not recursive
    6. not all of this join are constant or optimized away
    7. T is either
       7.1. a grouping table with GROUP BY list P
       or
       7.2. a non-grouping table with window functions over the same non-empty
            partition specified by the PARTITION BY list P
    8. P contains some references on the columns of the joined tables C
       occurred also in the select list of this join
    9. There are defined some keys usable for ref access of fields from C
       with available statistics.

  @details
    This function is called during the search for the best execution
    plan of the join that contains this table T. The function is called
    every time when the optimizer tries to extend a partial join by
    joining it with table T. Depending on what tables are already in the
    partial join different equalities usable for splitting can be pushed
    into T. The function evaluates different variants and chooses the
    best one. Then the function finds the plan for the materializing join
    with the chosen equality conditions pushed into it. If the cost of the
    plan turns out to be less than the cost of the best plan without
    splitting the function set it as the true plan of materialization
    of the table T.
    The function caches the found plans for materialization of table T
    together if the info what key was used for splitting. Next time when
    the optimizer prefers to use the same key the plan is taken from
    the cache of plans
