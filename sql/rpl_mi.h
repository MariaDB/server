/*****************************************************************************
  Replication IO Thread

  Master_info contains:
    - information about how to connect to a master
    - current master log name
    - current master log offset
    - misc control variables

  Master_info is initialized once from the master.info file if such
  exists. Otherwise, data members corresponding to master.info fields
  are initialized with defaults specified by master-* options. The
  initialization is done through init_master_info() call.

  The format of master.info file:

  log_name
  log_pos
  master_host
  master_user
  master_pass
  master_port
  master_connect_retry

  To write out the contents of master.info file to disk ( needed every
  time we read and queue data from the master ), a call to
  flush_master_info() is required.

  To clean up, call end_master_info()
