/**
  @brief
    Resolve table references to CTE from a sub-chain of table references

  @param tables      Points to the beginning of the sub-chain
  @param tables_last Points to the address with the sub-chain barrier

  @details
    The method resolves tables references to CTE from the chain of
    table references specified by the parameters 'tables' and 'tables_last'.
    It resolves the references against the CTE definition occurred in a query
    or the specification of a CTE whose parsing tree is represented by
    this LEX structure. The method is always called right after the process
    of parsing the query or of the specification of a CTE has been finished,
    thus the chain of table references used in the parsed fragment has been
    already built. It is assumed that parameters of the method specify a
    a sub-chain of this chain.
    If a table reference can be potentially a table reference to a CTE and it
    has not been resolved yet then the method tries to find the definition
    of the CTE against which the reference can be resolved. If it succeeds
    it sets the field TABLE_LIST::with to point to the found definition.
    It also sets the field TABLE_LIST::derived to point to the specification
    of the found CTE and sets TABLE::db.str to empty_c_string. This will
    allow to handle this table reference like a reference to a derived handle.
    If another table reference has been already resolved against this CTE
    and this CTE is not recursive then a clone of the CTE specification is
    constructed using the function With_element::clone_parsed_spec() and
    TABLE_LIST::derived is set to point to this clone rather than to the
    original specification.
    If the method does not find a matched CTE definition in the parsed fragment
    then in the case when the flag this->only_cte_resolution is set to true
    it just moves to the resolution of the next table reference from the
    specified sub-chain while in the case when this->only_cte_resolution is set
    to false the method additionally sets an mdl request for this table
    reference.

  @notes
    The flag this->only_cte_resolution is set to true in the cases when
    the failure to resolve a table reference as a CTE reference within
    the fragment associated with this LEX structure does not imply that
    this table reference cannot be resolved as such at all.

  @retval false  On success: no errors reported, no memory allocations failed
  @retval true   Otherwise

  @details
    The method creates a clone of the specification used in this element.
    The clone is created for the given reference to the table defined by
    this element.
    The clone is created when the string with the specification saved in
    unparsed_spec is fed into the parser as an input string. The parsing
    this string a unit object representing the specification is built.
    A chain of all table references occurred in the specification is also
    formed.
    The method includes the new unit and its sub-unit into hierarchy of
    the units of the main query. I also insert the constructed chain of the 
    table references into the chain of all table references of the main query.
    The method resolves all references to CTE in the clone.

  @note
    Clones is created only for not first references to tables defined in
    the with clause. They are necessary for merged specifications because
    the optimizer handles any such specification as independent on the others.
    When a table defined in the with clause is materialized in a temporary table
    one could do without specification clones. However in this case they
    are created as well, because currently different table references to a
    the same temporary table cannot share the same definition structure.
