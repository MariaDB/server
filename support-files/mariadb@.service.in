# Multi instance version of MariaDB
#
# Use this if you run multiple instances of MariaDB on a single server.
#
# This systemd service is not suitable for Galera as specialised SST recovery
# scripts are needed.
#
#
# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades.  If you want to customize, the
# best way is to create a file "/etc/systemd/system/mariadb@.service",
# containing
#	.include /usr/lib/systemd/system/mariadb@.service
#	...make your changes here...
# or create a file "/etc/systemd/system/mariadb@.service.d/foo.conf",
# which doesn't need to include ".include" call and which will be parsed
# after the file mariadb@.service itself is parsed.
#

#
# MULTI INSTANCES
#
# When multiple instances of MariaDB are running on a server they need to
# ensure that they don't conflict with each other. This includes elements
# like network ports, sockets and data directories listed under CONFLICTING
# VARIABLES below. The systemd environment variable MYSQLD_MULTI_INSTANCE
# controls each instance to ensure it is run independently. It is passed to
# mariadbd and mysql_install
#
# By default, a group suffix exists and within the default configuration
# files, a group [mariadbd.{instancename}] is read for each service. Other
# default groups, like [server.{instancename}] and [mariadb.{instancename}],
# are also read. For each instance, one of the groups will need to contain
# the conflicting variables listed below under CONFLICTING VARIABLES.
#
# The MYSQLD_MULTI_INSTANCE environment used is:
#    Environment='MYSQLD_MULTI_INSTANCE=--defaults-group-suffix=.%I --basedir=@prefix@'
#
#
# APPLYING YOUR MULTI INSTANCE MECHANISM
#
# To apply one of the non-default multi-instance mechanisms, create a file
# "/etc/systemd/system/mariadb@.service.d/multi.conf" containing:
#
#   [Service]
#   Environment=MYSQLD_MULTI_INSTANCE="...."
#
# Include any other settings you which to override. Directives like Exec* are
# lists and adding a directive will append to the list. You can clear the list
# by starting with "Directive=" and no value. Follow this by the list that you
# do want. See the systemd.unit(5) manual page for more information.
#
# Then run "systemctl daemon-reload".
#
#
# EXAMPLE MYSQLD_MULTI_INSTANCE CONFIGURATIONS
#
# Configuration File Based Mechanism:
#
# This has a configuration file per instance.
#
#   [Unit]
#   ConditionPathExists=@sysconfdir@/my.%I.cnf
#
#   [Service]
#   Environment=MYSQLD_MULTI_INSTANCE=--defaults-file=@sysconfdir@/my.%I.cnf
#
# Here you need to create a configuration file @sysconfdir@/my.%I.cnf for each
# instance, each containing the conflicting variables to separate instances.
#
#
# Multi User Based Mechanism:
#
# Here each user (the instance name) has their own mysql instance.
#
# Create instances in users home directory with abstract socket:
#
#   [Service]
#   User=%I
#   ProtectHome=false
#   ExecStartPre=
#   ExecStartPre=@scriptdir@/mysql_install_db $MYSQLD_MULTI_INSTANCE \
#       --auth-root-authentication-method=socket --auth-root-socket-user=%I
#   Environment=MYSQLD_MULTI_INSTANCE="--defaults-file=/home/%I/my%I.cnf \
#       --datadir=/home/%I/mysqldatadir --skip-networking --socket=@mysql-%I"
#
#
# Command Line Mechanism:
#
# This is a good way run multiple instance where there is little difference
# in configuration between instances.
#
#   [Service]
#   Environment=MYSQLD_MULTI_INSTANCE="--socket=/run/mysqld/%I.sock \
#                        --datadir=/var/lib/mysqld-multi/%I \
#                        --skip-networking"
#
#
# CONFLICTING VARIABLES
#
# A number of MariaDB system variables may conflict. The main ones that need to
# be set because their default values will conflict are:
#   * socket
#   * port
#   * datadir
#
#
# PRE-10.4
#
# Before 10.4 MYSQLD_MULTI_INSTANCE was effectively --defaults-file=@sysconf2dir@/my%I.cnf
# As @sysconfdir@/my.cnf included these files it was a bad choice as an
# existing single instance would include all these files. If you want to
# continue a file based multi-instance mariadbd, recommend the Configuration File
# Based Mechanism above and moving @sysconf2dir@/my%I.cnf files to @sysconfdir@/my%I.cnf.
#
#
# SELINUX
#
# As basic selinux rules are written around a single instance of MariaDB you may need
# to define labels for the files and network ports of all instances.
#
# See: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/what-to-do-if-mariadb-doesnt-start/#selinux
#
#
# STARTING
#
# Start the instance: systemctl start mariadb@{instancename}.service
#
#
# DOCUMENTATION:
#
# Read https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/systemd/ regarding customisation.
#
# Also see systemd man pages: systemd.unit(5), systemd.exec(5) and
# systemd.service(5)
