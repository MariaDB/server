# !include this file into your my.cnf (or any of *.cnf files in /etc/my.cnf.d)
# and it will enable data at rest encryption. This is a simple way to
# ensure that everything that can be encrypted will be and your
# data will not leak unencrypted.
#
# Note that for the encryption to work, you must generate a key with
# the following command: openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -k mypass -P -md sha1
# Paste the key=[encryption key] contents into a file with the following format:
# 1;[encryption key]
# Please check https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/data-at-rest-encryption/ for more info.
#
# If in the future more encryption related options will be implemented,
# this file will enable them too.
