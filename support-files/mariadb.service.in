# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades.  If you want to customize, the
# best way is to create a file "/etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service",
# containing
#	.include /usr/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service
#	...make your changes here...
# or create a file "/etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/foo.conf",
# which doesn't need to include ".include" call and which will be parsed
# after the file mariadb.service itself is parsed.

## USERs can override

## by creating a file in /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/MY_SPECIAL.conf

# Set an explicit Start and Stop timeout of 900 seconds (15 minutes!)
# this is the same value as used in SysV init scripts in the past

TimeoutStartSec=900

# Set the maximium number of tasks (threads) to 99% of what the system can
# handle as set by the kernel, reserve the 1% for a remote ssh connection,

# be 15% (see DefaultTasksMax in systemd man pages).
