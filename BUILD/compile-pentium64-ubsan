# Compilation with UBSAN, The Undefined Behavior Sanitizer
# We have to use -Wno-uninitialized and -Wno-unitialized we get a lot of false
# positive warnings for this when compiling with -fsanitize=undefined.
# We also have to compile without Spider as linking with Spider library does
# not work. (errno: 11, undefined symbol: _ZTI12ha_partition)
