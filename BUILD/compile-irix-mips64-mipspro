# C options:
# -apo          - auto-parallize for multiprocessors (implies -mp)
# -mp           - generate multiprocessor code
# These two common optimization options apparently use 'sproc' model of
# threading, which is not compatible with PTHREADS: don't add them unless you
# know what you're doing.
#
# -c99          - enable C features standardized in C99, such as long long,
#                 strtoll, stroull etc.
#                 This option is vital to compile MySQL.
# -woff         - turn off some warnings 
# -64           - generate 64 bit object (implies -mips4)
# -mips4        - produce code for MIPS R10000, MIPS R12000 and further 64 bit
#                 processors
# -OPT:Olimit=0 - no limits exists to size of function for compiler to optimize
#                 it

# -LANG:std=OFF                   - don't link standard C++ library, such as
#                                   <iostream>, <complex>, etc. 
# -LANG:libc_in_namespace_std=OFF - libstdc functions can be
