# This Gitlab-CI pipeline offers basic validation that a commit did not
# introduce easily detectable regressions. Builds run primairly on a new Fedora,
# which has all the latest upstream build dependencies and thus is the primary
# testing target, as eventually everything in Fedora becomes the next CentOS and
# Red Hat releases.
#
# In addition test building on CentOS 7 and 8 to ensure that the code base
# remains reasonably backwards compatible.
#
# This is now intentionally simple, to keep it fast and accurate with minimal
# false positive failures. If one wants to extend it, see debian/salsa-ci.yml
# for inspiration on more integration tests to run.
#
# Also make sure the pipeline stays within the bounds of what CI workers on
# Gitlab-CI are capable of executing, thus ensuring that any potential
# contributor can at any point in time fork to their own Gitlab account and
# start working towards meaningful contributions!
#
# NOTE TO MERGERS: Most of the contents in the Gitlab-CI configuration has been
# tailored for a specific release or MariaDB. As a general rule, do not merge
# changes in this file across MariaDB branches to avoid breaking the CI. Updates
# the Gitlab-CI pipeline are most of the time better done manually per major
# release branch.

  - build
  - test

  # Extend build jobs to have longer timeout as the default GitLab
  # timeout (1h) is often not enough

# submodules (a commit in this repo does not affect their builds anyway) and
# many components that are otherwise slow to build.

  CMAKE_FLAGS: "-DWITH_SSL=system -DPLUGIN_COLUMNSTORE=NO -DPLUGIN_ROCKSDB=NO -DPLUGIN_S3=NO -DPLUGIN_MROONGA=NO -DPLUGIN_CONNECT=NO -DPLUGIN_MROONGA=NO -DPLUGIN_TOKUDB=NO -DPLUGIN_PERFSCHEMA=NO -DWITH_WSREP=OFF"
  # Major version dictates which branches share the same ccache. E.g. 10.6-abc
  # and 10.6-xyz will have the same cache.
  MARIADB_MAJOR_VERSION: "11.0"
  # NOTE! Currently ccache is only used on the Centos8 build. As each job has
  # sufficiently different environments they are unable to benefit from each
  # other's ccaches. As each build generates about 1 GB of ccache, having
  # multiple caches would quickly consume all free storage on Gitlab-CI and
  # grind all builds to a halt. Also the network overhead of download/upload
  # decreases the benefit of ccache in Gitlab-CI, and current cache:when and
  # cache:policy are not flexible enough to have a system where the cache is
  # uploaded only once a week and not on every build. Having ccache on at least
  # one build still helps ensure that ccache compatibility is at least tested
  # and if the Centos 8 build is always significantly faster than all other
  # builds (e.g. on self-hosted Gitlab instances) then users would at least be
  # able to discover it.
