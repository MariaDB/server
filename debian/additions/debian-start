# where they do not block the server start and in one shell instance so that
# they run sequentially. They are supposed not to echo anything to stdout.
# If you want to disable the check for crashed tables comment
# "check_for_crashed_tables" out.
# (There may be no output to stdout inside the background process!)

# Need to ignore SIGHUP, as otherwise a SIGHUP can sometimes abort the upgrade
