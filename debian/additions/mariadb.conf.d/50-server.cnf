# * Basic Settings
#

#user                    = mysql
pid-file                = /run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
basedir                 = /usr
#datadir                 = /var/lib/mysql
#tmpdir                  = /tmp

# Broken reverse DNS slows down connections considerably and name resolve is
# safe to skip if there are no "host by domain name" access grants
#skip-name-resolve

# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.
bind-address            = 127.0.0.1

# * Fine Tuning
#

#key_buffer_size        = 128M
#max_allowed_packet     = 1G
#thread_stack           = 192K
#thread_cache_size      = 8
# This replaces the startup script and checks MyISAM tables if needed
# the first time they are touched
#myisam_recover_options = BACKUP
#max_connections        = 100
#table_cache            = 64

#
# * Logging and Replication
#

# Note: The configured log file or its directory need to be created
# and be writable by the mysql user, e.g.:
# $ sudo mkdir -m 2750 /var/log/mysql
# $ sudo chown mysql /var/log/mysql

# Both location gets rotated by the cronjob.
# Be aware that this log type is a performance killer.
# Recommend only changing this at runtime for short testing periods if needed!
#general_log_file       = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log
#general_log            = 1

# Error logging goes via stdout/stderr, which on systemd systems goes to
# journald.
# Enable this if you want to have error logging into a separate file
#log_error = /var/log/mysql/error.log
# Enable the slow query log to see queries with especially long duration
#log_slow_query_file    = /var/log/mysql/mariadb-slow.log
#log_slow_query_time    = 10
#log_slow_verbosity     = query_plan,explain
#log-queries-not-using-indexes
#log_slow_min_examined_row_limit = 1000

# The following can be used as easy to replay backup logs or for replication.
# note: if you are setting up a replica, see README.Debian about other
#       settings you may need to change.
#server-id              = 1
#log_bin                = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
expire_logs_days        = 10
#max_binlog_size        = 100M

# * SSL/TLS

# For documentation, please read

#
# * Character sets
#

# MariaDB default is now utf8 4-byte character set.
# No Debian specific default is required.

#
# * InnoDB
#

# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!
# Most important is to give InnoDB 80 % of the system RAM for buffer use:
# https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-system-variables/#innodb_buffer_pool_size
#innodb_buffer_pool_size = 8G

# this is only for embedded server
[embedded]

# This group is only read by MariaDB servers, not by MySQL.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MySQL and MariaDB,
# you can put MariaDB-only options here
[mariadbd]

# This group is only read by MariaDB-12.1 servers.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MariaDB of different versions,
# use this group for options that older servers don't understand
[mariadb-12.1]
