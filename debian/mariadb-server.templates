Template: mariadb-server/old_data_directory_saved
Type: note
_Description: The old data directory will be saved at new location
 A file named /var/lib/mysql/debian-*.flag exists on this system.
 The number indicates a database binary format version that cannot automatically
 be upgraded (or downgraded).
 .
 Therefore the previous data directory will be renamed to /var/lib/mysql-* and
 a new data directory will be initialized at /var/lib/mysql.
 .
 Please manually export/import your data (e.g. with mysqldump) if needed.

Template: mariadb-server/nis_warning
Type: note
#flag:translate!:3,5
_Description: Important note for NIS/YP users
 Using MariaDB under NIS/YP requires a mysql user account to be added on
 the local system with:
 .
  adduser --system --group --home /var/lib/mysql mysql
 .
 You should also check the permissions and ownership of the
 /var/lib/mysql directory:
 .
  /var/lib/mysql: drwxr-xr-x   mysql    mysql

Template: mariadb-server/postrm_remove_databases
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Remove all MariaDB databases?
 The /var/lib/mysql directory which contains the MariaDB databases is about
 to be removed.
 .
 If you're removing the MariaDB package in order to later install a more
 recent version or if a different mariadb-server package is already
 using it, the data should be kept.
