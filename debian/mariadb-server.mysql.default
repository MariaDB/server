# NOTE: This file is read only by the traditional SysV init script.
# Debian 9 and Ubuntu 17.04 onward do not normally read this file as they use
# systemd by default.
#
# For similar behavior, systemd users should override ExecStart by dropping
# files into /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/

# Note also that MariaDB systemd does _not_ utilize mysqld_safe.

# The delay in seconds the init script waits for the server to be up and running after having started "mysqld_safe" to run the "/etc/mysql/debian-start" script.
# If the server is still not responding after the delay, the script won't be executed and an error will be thrown on the syslog.
# Default: 30
#MYSQLD_STARTUP_TIMEOUT=30
