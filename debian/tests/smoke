# dep8 smoke test for mysql-server
# Author: Robie Basak <robie.basak at canonical.com>
#
# This test should be declared in debian/tests/control with a dependency
# on the package that provides a configured MariaDB server (eg.
# mariadb-server-10.6).
#
# This test should be declared in debian/tests/control with the
# following restrictions:
#
# needs-root (to be able to log into the database)
# allow-stderr
#
# This test:
#
# 1) Creates a test database and test user as the root user.
#
# 2) Creates a test table and checks it appears to operate normally
# using the test user and test database.
#
# 3) Checks compression support for InnoDB & RocksDB engine.
