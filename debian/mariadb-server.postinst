If you're reading this, it's most likely because you had replaced /var/lib/mysql
with a symlink, then upgraded to a new version of mysql, and then dpkg
removed your symlink (see #182747 and others). The mysql packages noticed
that this happened, and as a workaround have restored it. However, because
/var/lib/mysql seems to have been re-created in the meantime, and because
we don't want to rm -rf something we don't know as much about, we are going
to leave this unexpected directory here. If your database looks normal,
and this is not a symlink to your database, you should be able to blow
this all away.
