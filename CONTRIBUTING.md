MariaDB has a dedicated time each week when we answer new contributor questions live on Zulip.
From 8:00 to 10:00 UTC on Mondays, and 10:00 to 12:00 UTC on Thursdays, anyone can ask any questions they’d like,
and a live developer will be available to assist.
New contributors can ask questions any time, but we will provide immediate feedback during that interval.
