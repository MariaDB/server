  Weight of an illegal byte, must follow these rules:
  1. Must be greater than weight of any normal character in the collation.
  2. Two different bad bytes must have different weights and must be
     compared in their binary order.

  Depends on mbmaxlen of the character set, as well as how the collation
  sorts various single-byte and multi-byte character blocks.

  The macro below is the default definition, it is suitable for mbmaxlen=2
  character sets that sort all multi-byte characters after all single-byte
  characters: big5, euckr, gb2312, gbk.

  All mbmaxlen>2 character sets must provide their own definitions.
  All collations that have a more complex order (than just MB1 followed by MB2)
  must also provide their own definitions (see definitions for
  cp932_japanese_ci and sjis_japanese_ci as examples of a more complex order).
