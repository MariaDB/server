/* PR 15262.
   The alias analyzer only considers relations between pointers and
   symbols.  If two pointers P and Q point to the same symbol S, then
   their respective memory tags will either be the same or they will
   have S in their alias set.
   
   However, if there are no common symbols between P and Q, TBAA will
   currently miss their alias relationship altogether.  */
