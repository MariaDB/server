/* 
 This test checks promotion of bitfields.  Bitfields should be promoted
 very much like chars and shorts: 

 Bitfields (signed or unsigned) should be promoted to signed int if their
 value will fit in a signed int, otherwise to an unsigned int if their 
 value will fit in an unsigned int, otherwise we don't promote them (ANSI/ISO
 does not specify the behavior of bitfields larger than an unsigned int).

 We test the behavior by subtracting two from the promoted value: this will
 result in a negitive value for signed types, a positive value for unsigned
 types.  This test (of course) assumes that the compiler is correctly 
 implementing signed and unsigned arithmetic.
