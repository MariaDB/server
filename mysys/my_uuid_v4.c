  Implements Universal Unique Identifiers version 4, as described in
  draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis-14.

    Field                       Octet #          Note
  random_a                       0-5     Random CSPRNG 48 bits.
  ver                            6       The 4 bit version field, set to
                                         0b0100. Occupies bits 48 through 51 of
                                         octet 6.
  random_b                       6-7     Random CSPRNG 12 bits.
  var                            8       The 2 bit variant field, set to 0b10.
                                         Occupies bits 64 and 65 of octet 8.
  random_c                       8-15    Random CSPRNG 62 bits.

  The structure of an UUIDv4 is: llllllll-mmmm-Vhhh-vsss-nnnnnnnnnnnn
  The replacement of the version and variant field bits results in 122
  bits of random data.
